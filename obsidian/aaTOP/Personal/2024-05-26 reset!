major reset today.
Bret Butler: will not be impossible without personal revelation,   man... major reminder

sense of feeling the spirit: so strong and so close we miss it. it's already there. its already confirming truth. stop overlooking this.

82:10 bind God with my covenant making

* so overwhelmingly present, easy to miss.

- it's about maintaining the clarity and persistence to show God what we truly value.

"bound" direction and closeness. covebenave gives direction and closeness.

god would have us be happy, and focused.

freedom after the work: Legos instruction first, then you lean the freedom... it's the struggle that creates the freedom.

when we recognize Godz see more of his hand in things. 

knowing OF things, vs Knowing things: like God vs Knowing God.

every man has the light of Christ.

dc 93:1-2 forsake, go, call, keep God: know that he is. he needs to know us.

every knee shall bow and toughe confess, because we will know, not forced. 

so important to take these things into life.

dogs 3 rules:

100.percent legal... "because you can".

difference: we expect to be changed... we expect the path to be consistently growth inducing. this deepens our relationship with God.. approach God in faith 1 he esitsd 2 hell listen 3 covenanve.

trmlpe l covers all..covenant confidence.

goal have eye single to glory: path is rough. nice road when with God. emptiness when not in path. fullness is the other sensation.

being in right path...is what makes us change and gives freedom. desire to do other than the other disappears.

goal is transform: life: happiness is what we get, real abiding happiness.

our focus on Christ will make us more like him
