Laws . .

N Eldon Tanner - talk: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1975/10/the-laws-of-god?lang=eng

He Mentions 3 kinds of laws: nature, man, and God.  

The word law seems to imply restriction . . but at the same time keeps freedom available in an odd way.

think about how the laws of nature behave: they must be 100% obedient: any variation would really goof things up: think about how water behaves: when and how it freezes, boils, and has some amount of cohesion to bead up: all of these behaviors and more really affect how even at the macro level things behave  .
