note to mike/gretchen/leah . maybe my parents . .

Hey guys! I've had the most excellent experience lately. On Sunday, June 29th, our bishop asked us to pick a goal on something to get better at, write it on a card, and drop it in a bottle.

My goal was to really and truely study the gospel EVERY MORNING. While I haven't done it every day, I have found that I am so much more calm and clear minded. I have so much more confidence and have had some real items learned as a result.

This plus the whole Cunningham family FANTASTIC help in fixing our home has been huge.
