,lots of kids doing testimonies. quiet cool.

Small moments.

as we live our lives, we can easily see the wide range of experiences we have. everything from eating a bowl of cereal to going on a river rafting trip. some experiences are positive and some are not. 

it seems that a big purpose of life is simply to experience. all of this experience can deeply affect us. some for the better, and some not so much as time passes, ideally we'd learn from everything that happens to us. I found I tend to just get older and more angry in a lot of cases, however I'm so thankful for those small moments. that seems to have an overwhelming amount of joy. it reminds me that this Joy truly is the goal. God is with us through it all. 

while I think I love having church earlier in the morning i realize that I've started to see Sunday as an interruption to my week instead of a highlight. having it earlier, is even more so. I've found I want to change that. I can feel the spirit pushing me to reset this behavior, and see Sunday worship as a time I prepare for, instead of just deal with.

 my wife bought a picture of a quote that life is meant to be enjoyed not just endured. I've allowed many aspects in life to just be something I endure. I'm so glad that we have the spirit to help us seenthings jn our life that need to change. 

I love those small moments that make life worth it. where things are simply just right for a moment. whole it feels that my life is more often then not a dumpster fire, I can see and feel the power to change. that for me is goal of the atonement. what a blessing that is.
