Growth is possible because we lack perfection. I can't decide if the definition of perfection means that growth is no longer possible? When we say God is perfect, does that mean he can longer progress? Is that why we exist, to experience the process of growth & perfection through him?

How does a perfect being spend their time? . .especially when Time isn't a thing?
