Yesterday, while driving from Santaquin to Shannon and heather's house, a really cool idea occured to me . . Creating a 'person' called bob - that finds he is concious and able to detect value .and make choices . .
need to draw a picture.

The summary is this: if bob finds himself with consciousness, as an human does, a few things become apparent:
* he has the ability to detect and want value.
* He has the ability to make choices.
While both can be somewhat non-perfect, they do give a starting point.

After enough choice and consequence, he starts to see that there are some choices that are better than others, and he can start searching for value. These values lead to principals; which seem to really hep guide bob in his decision making. 

Bob then builds primary and secondary beliefs (and so on), so that things he begins to believe become closer to him as he learns and choses to believe them, or farther away if needed.

Bob realizes that as he thinks about his ability to make choices, an 'engine' or 'function' of sorts appears: he realizes he has the ability for critical thinking. We'll call this box 1. he can reason out lots of things, and come up with a better life simply by looking back on experiences, gathering trousted sources, etc.

After a while though as he studies, a new engine seems to appear: a sort of inspiration engine: when he studies some things, the inpsiration engine lights up: the cirtical thinking engine is wary, but it's hard to discard this second engine, which we'll call box 2.

there are times where box1 and box2 disagree; but it's in those cases where information can be put into either box, with some sort of answer that comes out, then shift/and put information back into each other box until finally, additional beliefs & principals can be discovererd, and bob becomes more in some way: as if his collection of beliefs has caused him to increase in quality.

This second engine is difficult to ignore:  (going for bike ride with shannon)- 7/13/2025 11:33:39 AM- not yet . . 

So summary:
box 1: critical thinking
box 2: holy ghost/inspiration/Religious receipt of information from a source typically thought of as religious or God.
box 3: Possible?

Box 3 may be Reiki or something similar; this is the area that I'm the weakest in: We have too much baggage in our heads - subconcious & other tendencies that can get in the way and affect things; making it harder for things like this to be immediately understood.
