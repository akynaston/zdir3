Ok, I'll suggest Advair HFA to my doctor, and see if he'll change the perscription - that's the next step right?

but an alternative to
Advair HFA is
Flovent HFA which is a tier 1 and has a $10 copay
yes arnuity elipta is also a tier 1



I have three options covered by insurance; here they are in order of preference by cost; but I'd love to hear your recommendation:

FloventHFA - at $10
Arnuity Elipta - at $10
Advair HFA - but is a $75 copay . .
