I felt I needed to write exactly what I believe...

want to start by using articles of faith. 

#1 totally good with. God, Jesus, spirit.
#2 not for Adams transgression: just makes sense toe, no issues.

#3 atonemenet: in this one I think I fully believe the mechanics of being in a fallen state and needing reperation, though I have no idea how it is done... seems like a pretty big thing to feel such a vague need for, yet have it so undefined.

The creation of this life caused a need for a redeemer.... we had to be in a state where failure was possible, and choosesble.

somehow it is possible for someone to pay the price of sin as it were... makes this life a way to prove ourselves rather than an definite loss of all life.

this life then becomes a place of learning hopeyand growth, and meets it's original goal. death in both states is taken care of.

another key point: ALL mankind may be saved. a plan of redemption that applies to all of us is super cool.

summary: I believe this, thought it's a big one
