to brent: 
I've been thinking about belief, sin, guilt, obedience, religion, cults and lots of related stuff lately; would be fun to have a catch up chat at some point. I think quite a bit of bull crap and other broken ways of thinking have finally died off in my head, and I think it's been a really healthy change.

If you disagree at all with anything I have to say, please feel free to immediately stop me and disagree - I can't get offended, and I love to know more about you if you don't mind.

 - * I don't think we really understand the concept of sin. I think most people think it's this ugly black mark on some permanent record sitting on your file in heaven; and I've started to believe it's more a word that tries to describe the consequences of a broken natural law. God simply doesn't want us to have to deal with broken natural laws. It's inconvenient and damming in the most simple mechanical sense, zero religion required.
* Look at addiction
	* Really love it, deeply enjoyable; but always leaves me feeling physically sick; mostly due to the crappy sleep.
	* The drawback is of course the super crappy sleep. UP to a few months ago, I wasn't concerned about being less interested in leah; then I realized how much of a dopamine rush it gave me, and that it can easily slip into a replacement, and this is the physical damming I'm trying to talk about: it moves ME away from My own goals and things that bring me real happiness.
	* I am concerned that if I were to lose Leah, I suspect a lot of my values might go away too.
	* I find that I get turned on much more quickly . . which is quite enjoyable; but turns on this pleasure monster inside - and I think it's just basic human tendencies; but now I've seen it myself: the push towards an incessant acquisition of pleasure that pushes all actual remaining value out of my life!
* listening to Was i in a cult podcast. I can see that any religion, belief structure or way of life can easily become a cult.  Even components of a belief can become super cultish and almost ruin the rest of it.

* success vs meaning
* "Was I in a cult"
	* Finding: any belief structure, or components of it can become a cult!
* Becoming yourself:
	* Maslows hiearchy of needs: once the basics are taken care of ![[il_794xN.5622146268_pp0g.avif]]
	* Confusion: Success vs Meaning: It seems that meaning is the only kind of real success.
	* Many kinds of success are not meaning and can be empty.
	* Real meaning found in others or situations.
		* I find deep meaning being able to have these kinds of conversations with you and try to have life make some sense, or at least have us assign our own sense to what we see.
	* Pleasure is not success, and not meaning.
	* Become more yourself by finding meaning; meaning seems to be tied into others, or specific situations.
	* Viktor Frankl podcast: Human being doesn't want to be happy, but to have reason to be happy.
* So then: releigion and believe simply becaomes a choice: Faith seems to be a habitual choice . .
