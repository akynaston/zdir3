Adam is going to work at every hospital in the usa.
Emily - Swiftinating
Dorel - Animal management in woodland hills, and is a lower case Swifty
Lizzy - is already kickcing but, working to be a missionary.
  End with some advice to Lizzy about your mission: One possibly obvious thing that I know I probably should have realized beforehand, but your love of the people you see and work with will be much stronger than you expect. When you are pushed to move all of our focus outside of yourself it seems to create a much better you.



I've loved the updates, so good to hear from you all - even those of you who spam the crap out of the family channel <ahem> admin, I want to try a bit of an update:

AJ - is 10 - going to 6th grade


Leah cool keychain - continuing to work out.
