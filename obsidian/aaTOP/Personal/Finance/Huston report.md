July 254,417.16
Aug 247,195.74
Sep 254,447, an increase of 7K
Oct 252,856.56 down 2 k... Lots of variability, but the right general direction.
Nov 249,674.22 down 3k -  this looks like it's down . .but with a bigger bonus check, it should have gone down further. Had $1200 car fix this month; but doing a little better overall.
Dec 253,914.04** - Numbers are a bit skewed as this report is delayed - had another bout of depression; but back up again. This is up 4K; but it also is after paying this months loan payments, and paying 600 bucks for a SWA flight before I got setup on a RAMP card. I estimate about 2 grand of this is due to monthly loan payments. Next month will be interesting to see if I can get this report done on Dec 31/Jan 1..
Jan 252,974.58 (dec 31) Not terrible... Technically did have overruns, but very few. On a MUCH cheaper phone plan too!
Feb $251,587.34 - going down, super slow . . had to pay a chunk of Holly's loans, big car fixes; but still down a little.
