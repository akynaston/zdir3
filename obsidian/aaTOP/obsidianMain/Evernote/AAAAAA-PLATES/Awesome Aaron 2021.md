 - Census: really good call with Willie: fully understand dibtest002 purpose, and why it seemed that he changed gears.  He kind of did - didn't really have a sense for it working properly.
      - Complete removal of anxiety.
      - Also made it clear I"m 100% on Census; Willie gave me enough mulitple testing work to last at least for a week or two.

 - Good call with Glen on BAES: he asked me to update AC based on ECR185 on the phase 2 w2ork <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lfj-o84znV3YCokqAW95yQju24igju6KpAeqBHpje6w/edit#gid=708506936>
      - Immediately had the anxiety that I didn't know what to do; so isntead of just saying bye and puting in my tody list, I started asking questions since the anxieyt flag was so clear now.
      - Glen realized their text wasn't sufficient for me to start making AC updates, and he's going back to them.

  - really pressured to make progress on Census, but Glen asked for a quick revew of something - When teddy wasn't available due to the hour, I was able to step back; realize I should get BAEs done, then back to Census - turns out We still didn't have all we needed, so was able to clear BAES out of my mind and move full back on Census. This wa regarding ECR185 (employee vs contingent workers)

From Feburary to now, I've been on Southwest airlines. Blissfully happy; but plays to my widget turning tendancies a little too much.

Internaly, helped to finish off laptop backups - Chris of course found Veeam, but was able to work with him to find ideal settings, and push on that for everyone.
      - Found ways to setup 

FTO - 
 - Started out ok sickwise, had more sickness than expected towards the second half of the year.
 - To stay right on track, I need to do a designer install or two over the holiday, and I think my numbers will be pretty coes.
 - Dang COVID now . .no fun.

* InTowards end of year of 2018 - Helped Joong pick a better plan for upgrading: using eDirectory replication rather than creating a difficult driver.

* Required udnerstanding of eDirectory replication and the eDirectory bidrectional and legacy drivers to recommend the best idea.

* Throughout the year - worked with Colton to pick up the updated Powershell driver,a nd answer questions about the old powershell driver.
* Halfway through the ForgeRock training - chapter 4 of 7; but I did go ahead and let the rest of the videos play in the crappy player and got the badge.
* Throughout the year - continued to help on BAES as needed - there were some complicated bugs that needed to be reviewed, and I worked with Carl to get them resolved  - IDM job and IDM engine related items - answering questions that either requires experience or hours of trace review and knowing what the engine will do.
* There was some complicated FCPS trace review items I was able to help Colton on.
* Learned Git, and continue to learn a lot about core commands, maintaining the repo integrity, rebasing, merging the proper way, and adopting some healthy workflows to keep things clean.

* Assisted multiple people with git questions - Jason, Alex and Chris have had quesitons that I've been able to help them work out - involving rebasing to resolve branch issues, and interactive rebasing to squahs commits and simply delete unwanted commits from history, while still maintaining a development branch at that point.

* Worked with Chris to push forward on our data center servers 
* Helped Michelle multiple times on eDirectory replication and IDM and IDMUnit questions.
	
* Maintained a cleaner office than normal - this really helps me concentrate.
* On the personal side of things, I've resolved some issues that were distracting me - has helped a great deal in my concentration.

* find that I can be here fully, and know that I can give fair time my family and TriVir; I've struggled a bit with that in the past.

To do better:

* Biggest issue was my same trouble - where I'll dig forever on something before I have the project time to support the work.
* Second, related - not keeping the AC with me as a guide. Would have forced me to ask questions at the right time.
* Adopt similar svn workflow habits in Git - potentially could have saved some time.
* adopt a more disciplined management of time split between training and project time - I don't yet have a regular training time.
* I have a lot of open threads still - I need to visit each item more often and either push items off, or not do them if they aren't important enough.
* Personal side

* Been sick a lot - not sure what to do here, other than to stay on top of my asthma meds, and maybe see a pulminaologyist - this seems to really goof up my concentration.
