# Things I'm passionate about

* My kids smiling at me.
* My kids running to give me a hug when I get home.
* Music
	* HARMONY
		* For me, harmony in music, the apparent balance in Lagrange points in space, Photosynthisis - Everyhting to do with Gravity and black holes (at least the part we understand) is like a cheat code to believe in God - While it seems odd to cherry pick a belife in God where there's only one cherry, (my observations); it fills me with such a deep wonder, that I can't hep but believe.
	* Clarinet: listening, playing, etc.
	* Piano
