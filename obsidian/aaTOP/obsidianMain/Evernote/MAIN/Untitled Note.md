             - glen to send it off
             - Designe rpushing . . .

        9 - Logging driver
             - I looked it over, and it does have some things we could potentially make better in like 4-6 hours but it's functionally sufficient, it's pretty straightforward. At first review, it doesn't seem worth BAES or Trivir's time to do anything, my updates would just reduce the amount of code really, and not speed it up much.             
             - ADD TO THE BUILD . .
             - gLEN: LOOKED AT DRIVER - BUT CAN improve driver, but not worht our time; martins driver.
             - His concern: ok for us to do deployments that overwrite it.
             - this ill be haping from now moving forwrad.
             - Add it to the build, so it doesn't get wipe dout . .
             - Be very clear about us overwriting his driver . .
             - Not adding version stamping - just adding it to the zip, doesn't touch - just packaged together, this is fine.
             - \*\*\* Glen - another note: include in readme: describe what is in the package - want to list the driver and make note that this is Martin Flexmens' driver, and directed to him . .

        10 - the IDV2BC and BC2IDV drivers - it's been forever, but it seems like we decided to not go with the BC tree, do you remember? Seem like we should delete the driver, then pull them out of history if we need them.
             - Bounday contrun not part of oslution . .
             - Trash these.
             - shoot this off to client as emai lfirst, and get agreement.
             - just get rid of them . .
