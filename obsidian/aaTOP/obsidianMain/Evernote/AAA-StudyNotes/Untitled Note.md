9/5/2017 6:11:28 AM The Role of the Atonement

Recently, I felt a need to increase my study of the Gospel. Despite the fact that I love and care about the scriptures, I found the practice of simply reading the next chapter to be somewhat direction-less and focus-less   While I may move back to that in some future date, I realized I wanted to focus on one specific item of the gospel at a time. This way, my reading an be focused, and I can work to learn something new. While the main course of this will be LDS teachings, I will include other religions only because it's interesting to note what the rest of the world has come up with. While I don't personally subscribe to any other religion, it is interesting to see what people come up with where reason is the only source of information an revelation is ignored to some degree.

The word Atonement simply menas to reconcile a man to god (<https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/atone-atonement>). Of course, this means I had to ensure I understood what reconcile means. Reconcile is to restore friendly relations between some one; to make compatible, or coexist in harmony (google: reconcile). Further on the lds website, the atonement allows for the penaltiy of sin to be removed from him; thereby allowing men to be reconciled with God.

Jehova's Witnesses believe that Jesus was just a man, albiet a good enough man that his atonement could over come the effects of Adam's transgression.  This is interesting to me: It almost seems obvious that God would have come up with a way to resolve our separation from him, but why would he only provide a way to resolve the physical separation? I suppose I"m implying that God solved both the physical and spiritual issues of separation by what Jesus did; and JW's seem to believe the spiritual side is taken care of in some other way.
