I sure have loved that we are learning the book of mormon this year it's been fantastic to be back in it again.

The lesson today covers a time of Lehi and his family where they've had a bunch of trials, and it's been super interesting to me to see how each member of the family dealt with the pain.

 - I am not yet thankful for my trials. I think they're upsetting, frustrating and make me grouchy.
 - I do ahve to say though once you get through a trial, man that feels fantastic. To know that you've made it past something super difficult, AND knowing that you are stronger person.

Unfortunately, life isn't meant to be easy. Learning and Growth never is. The nature of learning is that we become something different afterwards; and this can be painful, take time and require thought and effort. all those annoying things.

* Before we jump into things; I wanted to share with you an experience that I had that was kinda dumpy and frustrating. Maybe after this Brother Baccus would share a trial of his.
	* When I was about 10, forever ago, my mom and dad were acting funny.  They said, "Kids, we need to talk" - They asked to talk with us kids, and you know that can't be a good thing. We got everyone together, and my mom and dad told us they were getting a divorce. I was super upset. I wanted slap them both upside the head, and say whats going on? Why do you have to do this?
	* Eventualy ny Parents  divorce was completed, and we made it through. I didn't find out until later, that it would really help me want to make sure my marriage would be amazing. My wife and I are very different people, but I find that I'm filled with this desire to focus on her happiness and the success of our rleatinship. I don't always do it,a nd we fight like cats and dogs, but I"m happy to say we're closer now than we've ever been despite some very real trials
		* I was going to compare 
			
* Broth Bacckus, do you have any trials?
* You guys ever had any trials, or is life just one bowl of icecream after another?


Does everyone have scriptures? we have afew to cover. The lesson also has a series of pretty cool videos; I'd like to show one or two if we have time.


Lets start by reading 1 Nephi 17:3

](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=3#p3)

Book of Mormon

3 And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while we did sojourn in the wilderness.


That first sentence is kinda intimidating. God's commandments must be fulfilled. Wow. It's overwhelming and humbling at the same time.

I'm really impressed by Nephi's responses to the troubles that he and his family had. I know if I were in the same situation, I'd like to think that I would be faithful but I'd probably sound like Lamen and lemual. 

I really enjoy reading about the life of Lehi's family, it's such a clear history of a family trying to deal with very real, very overwhelming struggles.

Ok - lets get into some scriptures. The scriptures we're going to go through describe a few struggles that Nephi's family had. 

1 Nephi 16:34–39 -  Ishamel died. Death is a giant pain in the but. It's something that requires us to accept, and that process is annoying at best. Vido on this one two if we have time - It gets so bad - read 37:
	37 And Laman said unto Lemuel and also unto the sons of Ishmael: Behold, let us [aslay](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16?lang=eng&id=34-39#note37a) our father, and also our brother Nephi, who has taken it upon him to be our [bruler](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16?lang=eng&id=34-39#note37b) and our teacher, who are his elder brethren.

1 Nephi 17:7–16; - (Video 3) Dang - what an interesting Trial - How many of you have ever been asked to build a boat? What kind was it? Was it hard? Do any of you cook? Man, I struggle getting toast cooked properly, but I am amazing with the mircrowave. Hot pockets are a blessing.
 - Thinking about Nephi's experience here, he was asked to build a boat - I think if that happened to me, I'd be saying you want me to do what now? But Nephi's response was prettys traight froward - 
 -  vers9, I love his response: And I said: Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make [atools](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=7-16#note9a) to construct the ship after the manner which thou hast shown unto me?
	 - Isn't that cool? I can imagine in his head he's thinking, Wow, I have no idea what I"m doing, but God will show me.  . I'm going to need tools . .uh oh, I don't have any . .I'm going to have to make the tools too - and that's what he asked. This really makes me want to improve my responses to things I"m asked.


1 Nephi 18:1–4 - This one talks more about the details of building a ship  I loved vers 2 where it says:
* 2 Now I, Nephi, did not work the timbers after the manner which was learned by men, neither did I build the ship after the manner of men; but I did build it after the manner which the Lord had shown unto me; wherefore, it was not after the manner of men.
* How would it be if everything we made these days was built as instructed by the lord? I really like well made things. I can imagine a pretty sweet Tesla, with no steering issues, and a nearly infiinte battery life to ame a few ideas.
* Can you imagine a cheeseburger made by God??? That would be spectactular.
* I found some random notes about how it likely took them 2 years to build a boat . .Ouch . .That is so amazing - That would take so much hardwork and faith.

1 Nephi 18:9–22 - Experiences over the first few weeks on the boat. Sounds like some classic examples of the pride cycle: things go well, so they get prideful. They have some big disaster, they fight, repent, then it starts over again. They're probably also a liittle scared too right? they're floating out on this boat they made themselves, and can only see water in every direction. Despite them getting prideful ocassionally, that had to have been rough.

Video 2 - Liahona
Video 4 - Sailing in the ship: Loved the parts about how it described that it was a curious s



=== ENDING
I know that Trials can really help us grow and learn. I would like to work on being thiankful for my trials; I know that as we go through them, we can get through them and be amazing.  

I know God lives and Jesus Christ is our savoir.  we say this in the name of Jesus christ amen.
