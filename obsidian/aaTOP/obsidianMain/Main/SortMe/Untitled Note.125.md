We are going to talk about something today that you do every single day. In fact, we're doing it right now. Can you guys guess what it is?
 - communicating!

Can any body tell me what communication means?  Does communication have to be speech? Can I communicate with just my hands? (thumbs up & show how t osay god in signlanguage)
Whta are some other ways?

How about in writing? Cna I write something and hav eyou guys know what I am saying?  How many of you can read?  When yo learn how to read, you can communicate in a new language - isn't that cool?

What about prayer? Is this a form of communication?  Yes, it is.  Who do we communicate with when we are using prayer? (others and god)

Can some one show me what we should do when we pray? Is it ok to run around and make noie when we pray?  Why?
      - we are trying to stay focused on what we are doing.
