Shela,

I sure appreciate your help with this, attached are the full two pages of the account and you can see the 522.40 listed at the bottom of page 2.  I don't think you need all of the numbers; but they're provided anyway to show how we arrived at the 522.40.

Here is my statement: 

Dear HeadStart,

I have recently had my boy have a dental operation to receive caps for some of his teeth (I believe it was 4 molars). My private insurance did cover some, but the remaining out of pocket comes to 522.40, and I am unable to make this payment.  I would appreciate any help HeadStart is able to provide; please let me know if you have any questions.

Shela, let me know if you need any more information, or have any concerns.

\--Aaron
