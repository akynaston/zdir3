Hilarious and fun. Might not have the best gameplay. But me and my friend thought it was awesome because how ridiculously fast the tanks moved, and how we could glitch out the map.

Good Start Room for Improvement Aiming and Hit detection needs to be improved. I want you to add Online and Bluetooth Multiplayer modes. Thanks
