# ITEMS LEARED FROM BAE CONSOLIDATION PROJECT

Estimating:
 - need to include 2 hours or so getting latest svn code, updating drivers.

 - I should include some VM time - 2 hours or so to ramp up - gettng vms, confirming first test passes to get plumbing and starting point clear, time spent removing usb, sound card.

 - I still estimate like I've never done this before . .as son as I'm in 'holy crap I've got to build this now mode', I realize how different (and more accurate) the tasks could have been.
