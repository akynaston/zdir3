Siddhārtha Gautama, or Buddha, was a man born to a rich family in India around 500 B.C. He took a great interest in finding a solution to the suffering of humanity. After his father couldn’t promise him that he wouldn’t grow old, get sick, or die, he set out to meditate until he found the cure for misery and suffering. It took him 49 days and nights of sitting meditation under a peepal tree, also known as the ‘Bodhi Tree’, to find ‘enlightenment’ or ‘satori’. He then went about teaching and showing others the way to understanding. The teachings of Buddha serve as the foundation of Buddhism. These teaching can easily give guidance and greater peace of mind to anyone. Here are 30 quotes from Buddha to help guide you toward wisdom and peace.

1. “The root of suffering is attachment.”

2\. “Give up anger, give up pride, and free yourself from worldly bondage. No sorrow can befall those who never try to possess people and things as their own.”

3\. “Purity and impurity depend on oneself; no one can purify another.”

4\. “Our life is shaped by our mind; we become what we think.”

5\. “One who conquers himself is greater than another who conquers a thousand times a thousand men on the battlefield.”

6\. “If you find no one to support you on the spiritual path, walk alone. There is no companionship with the immature.”

7\. “There is no fear for one whose mind is not filled with desires.”

8\. “If anything is worth doing, do it with all your heart.”

9\. “You yourself must strive. The Buddhas only point the way.”

10\. “Those who have destroyed the roots of jealousy have peace of mind always.”

11\. “There is no impurity greater than ignorance.”

12\. “The world is afflicted by death and decay. But the wise do not grieve, having realized the nature of the world.”

13\. “One is not wise because he talks a good deal. They are wise who are patient, and free from hate and fear.”

14\. “Whoever doesn’t flare up at someone who’s angry wins a battle hard to win.”

15\. “One is not noble who injures living creatures. They are noble who hurt no one.”

16\. “Guard your thoughts, words, and deeds. These three disciplines will speed you along the path to pure wisdom.”

17\. “Should you find a wise critic to point out your faults, follow him as you would a guide to hidden treasure.”

18\. “Do not give your attention to what others do or fail to do; give it to what you do or fail to do.”

19\. “When are you living in darkness, why don’t you look for light?”

20\. “When watching after yourself, you watch after others. When watching after others, you watch after yourself.”

21\. “Make your mind pure as a silversmith blows away the impurities of silver, little by little, instant by instant.”

22\. “Don’t try to build your happiness on the unhappiness of others. You will be enmeshed in a net of hatred.”

23\. “The wise are disciplined in body, speech, and mind. They are well controlled indeed.”

24\. “Light the lamp within; strive hard to attain wisdom.”

25\. “Resolutely train yourself to attain peace.”

26\. “Meditation brings wisdom; lack of meditation leaves ignorance. Know well what leads you forward and what holds you back, and choose the path that leads to wisdom.”

27\. “Give, even if you only have a little.”

28\. “Just as a solid rock is not shaken by the storm, even so the wise are not affected by praise or blame.”

29\. “Don’t waste a moment, for wasted moments send you on the downward course.”

30\. “If you forget the joy of life and get caught in the pleasures of the world, you will come to envy those who put meditation first.”
