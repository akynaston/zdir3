Story of Russian woman doing work for parents
I've realized that I enjoy stories ofthings thy happen in the temple. But i'd don't feel like they're necessary. Just hearing them makes me feel (as it probably does other) that I'm missing some thing where I don't think that I am. I think I am having a completely full experience without a sing angel or voice to my head.

He will come.
