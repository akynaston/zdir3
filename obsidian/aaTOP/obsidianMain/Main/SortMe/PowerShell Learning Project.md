# [PowerShell] Learning Project

\[PowerShell\] Learning Project

**Goal**
 - We would like to get to a point where we are doing more confident PowerShell development and not PowerShell hacking.
 - We want to feel as comfortable in PowerShell as we are in Java.

**Plan**
 - Aaron and Chris will work together to write a PowerShell Cmdlet.
 - We are hoping to spend a total of maybe 16 hours.
 - Maybe 4-5 hours a week. (If longer sessions make more sense then go for it. We just don't want to throw off other projects / deliverables).
 - We would like to get moving on this now to help with our Exchange Online work.
 - Later we could do a Lunch and Learn to spread your newfound knowledge.

**Billable?**
I believe that it will be 100% billable to FCPS. I think it will benefit the way we interact with PowerShell there and with other clients.
