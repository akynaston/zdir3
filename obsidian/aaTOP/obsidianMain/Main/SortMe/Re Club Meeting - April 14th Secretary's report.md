# Re: Club Meeting - April 14th: Secretary's report

All,

One minor correction: Jill Tingey was also in attendance.  I apologize for missing you Jill!  If I've missed any one else, please feel free to correct me. I'll cry only a little bit I promise. :-)

All,

Today's meeting was quite funny. I'm trying out a more verbose approach on the report.  While it was fun doing the report this way, it took longer than expected. I welcome feedback of any sort. Please add/remove announcements as needed.  If you need to fix my grammar and spelling, I promise I won't be offended ("Me fail English?  That's Umpossible!" -- Ralph Wiggum, The Simpsons).  I may be less talkative in future reports :-) Thanks to you guys for making it a great club that I enjoy deeply being a part of. (yes, I just ended that sentence with a preposition . . just keeping you on your toes).

Toastmasters: April 14th

With Kevin as president and Joe as the toastmaster, we started with a comment from Joe that tomorrow, is not only our beloved tax day (grimace), but is also Leonardo Da Vinci would be 563 tomorrow. I hope I can do something cool that makes people remember me when I turn 500 :-)

We began with the word of the day of Pratfall, I hope I don't make a pratfall while writing the weekly report and make a big fool of myself :-). The quote of the day was given by Jill, which was, "No act of kindness, no matter how small is ever wasted",  AESOP - Lion and the Mouse.

Then Dlayne (sp?) gave her speech, with "Wing Kings" giving us an excellent review of the monarch butterfly, including some cool facts about how the butterfly flies thousands of miles, and how this is possible. It's very cool that we can enjoy something that is so beautiful and even has the gift of flight.  I like wings too Dlayne :-).

We continued with Kim giving us a very funny speech on miscommunication, "Nothing is so simple that it can't be misunderstood".  With all our cool technology, it is now possible to mis-communicate faster than ever. Oh, and don't go to South Korea, they have a policy against nuts.  They will be incinerated!! And if you need to get some one's attention when you are stuck on a roof, you're better off remembering your cell phone. If you need a restroom, you should probably just find it yourself.

Leslie Walker then started Table Topics which was quite fun. She had us express goals, pains, and happinesses as if we were an inanimate object:
Aaron: My life as a car: This one was particularly funny and enjoyable (and narcissistic now!), though contained various pauses where a severe lack of creativity was expressed. It was quite fun in any event; at least from the drivers-seat-point-of-view.
Emmy: My life as a house: Very funny house that was simply done existing, ready to be cleaned or demolished, the order didn't matter.
Linda: My life as a toothbrush: Awesome thoughts from a tooth brush who wanted nothing more then to retire to cleaning corners and toilet bowls, and stay way from that horrible, green stain inducing green health food and corn chips.
Mary: My life as a PC: A very jealous life of a PC trying to share a home with a brand new tablet, relegated to being the print manager of the house.

Kevin Ford then started the general evaluations section of our meeting. Rosco evaluated Dlayne with various thoughts for improvement including removing the podium from your "stage", and commenting on the excellent information researched. Jessie Good then evaluated Kim. He noted he loves Kim's story telling ability, and that she should know that she is truly funny. (if I can add: your acting for the story telling was dead on - the waking of your husband was hilarious).

Joe then described a few of our awards, and how we stand now to get more rewards.  We have completed 8 out of 10 goals, the last two remaining require a total of 4 new Competent Communicator awards, which we believe we'll have at least one by the cut off date of June 30th.  Mary won the table topics, and Roscoe won best evaluator.

We had a little extra time at the end, so Michael was asked to give a quote he had prepared, which was "Chaos is creativity in search of form" - John Wellword

Leslie then updated us that TODAY is the beginning of the next membership drive going through September.  If you bring visitors and/or get new members, please let her know so she can track this.
