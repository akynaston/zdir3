TM - Speech #2 - Who's in the drivers seat?

Intro:
Aaron Kynaston is our next speaker. He has a deep love of truth wherever it can be found, especially as it pertains to living a better, happier life. IN his speech today, titled, "Who's in the driver's seat?" he will talk to us about a few ways that we can find ourselves fully in the drivers seat of our lives.

SHORT HAND:

 - Every one of you are completely happy with your life as it stands right now.  (dramatic pause).
 - mad/upset/disagree with this statement?
 - family gathering
      - guest: Cold play? Blue man group?
      - Not them, FAMILY THERAPIST - (SAD); first thing out of his mouth was this line.
 - mildly offended - fam therp. to famliy gathering - deodorant for birthday.
 - Birthday card: rotten tomatoes. If Use this stuff every day, we can be friends again, your pal tommy.
 - family gathering already mildly offended, when he drops this line.
 - Fine - happy list: House - check.  Job - check. I'm chubby - that doesn't make me happy - "epic fail"
 - Vote this psychiatrist off the lsland - appended, " everyone of you is completely happy with your life right now or else you have changed or accepted it by now."
 - I had an epphainy: Driver seat each of our own lives.
 - tt struck me that this concept was entirely hidden from me, yet completely obvious and even common sense at the same time; what a funny way to feel about a new idea. 
 - How?
     1 - Realize we always have choice to some degree or another.
     2 - Recognize that this choice exists in a space between stimulus and response.
     3 - Accept that true Self-Awareness is required to successfully live our lives.
     4 - Only by living by principals can we truely be the drivers of our lives.

Item      1 - Realize we always have choice to some degree or another.
 - familiar with 7 habits?
 - Covey - Victor Frankl - horrible things happen to him - infinte freedom.
 - in my life: most difficult how much comapin about doing the dishes.

Item      2 - Recognize that this choice exists in a space between stimulus and response.
 - Uniquely Human: we have a space between stimuls and response; this is where our self awareness, imagination, conscionse and independent will. 
 - This concept is deeply meaningful to me.

Item      3 - Accept that true Self-Awareness is required to successfully live our lives.
 - Mirror: turn off the judging portion of your brain completely.  
       - truely see the person standing back at you.
       - things you will love and things you won't love so much.
 - our minds are programemd to categorize judge, and basically survive.  Recognize this happening, but don't let those low level mental instints define who you are. 
 - Covey : Look for past habits and thought patterns that don't match what you truely want. Decide what you want then choose those principals that you can base your life on.

Item      4 - Only by living by principals can we truely be the drivers of our lives.
\- takes me to my next point: 
 
This brings me to item  4 - Only by living by principals can we truely be the drivers of our lives.
 - Using our selfawareness, imagination, conscience, independt will
 - select principals that mean something to us.
 - Reality is messy, uncontrolled, unexpected, down-right rude.
 - Relaity will threaten our plans, but principals are what reality is made of so isn't affected by the chaos.
Closing:
To attain the drivers seat in our life, we must recognize that we have choice, and can use our uniquely human talents to then carefully choose our responses from any stimulus. We must see ourselves with a combination of raw honesty yet gentle kindness, we can choose those principles that will be the foundation of who we decide to be.

FULL TALK:

 

Every one of you are completely happy with your life as it stands right now.  (dramatic pause).
Does this comment make you mad, upset or frustrated? I know it did me. A few years ago I set in a famly gathering and my uncel said he had invited a guest.  I remember thinking, OH OH - I hope it's cold play!!  Please be cold play!  Then  thought - Maybe it ts the blue man group! That would be so cool.  Unfortunately, the guest wasn't cold play, and it wasn't the goofy interesting blue man group. It was a family therapist (said said, and slow - arms flop down)

I suppose I was mildly offended at the time.  inviting a family therepist to a family gathering is like giving someone deodorant for their birthday right?  you can do it, but it is kinda dangerous, and has to be done tactfully.  I can see the birthday card now:

Dear Aaron,
You smell like rotten tomatoes.  If you put this here deodorant on every day, you wont stink so bad.  If you use it regularly we can be friends again, your pal tommy.

So as I sat there listenting to this guy, already in this partially offened mind set, then this phsyciatirst had the oddasity to say that I was completely happy with my olife as it stands right now.
     I went through my list of things in my life - 
      - Yes, I have a house that I love, it's messy, but it's mine and I"m making it better. Check 
      - I have a job that I love - ok - check #2.
     - I"m fat - hum . .That doesn't make me happy . .epic fail.  
Just as I was about to vote this sphyciatirst off the island (air quotes) - he then appended something to his goofy first sentence.  He said, "or else you would have changed or accepted it by now". (pause)

I immediately went from offended to  OH - I get it.  He was asking us Who is in the driver seat in our lives.

It struck me that this concept was entirely hidden from me, yet completely obvious and even common sense at the same time; what a funny way to feel about a new idea. 

So how do we become responsible for our lives? I see four ways.

1 - Realize we always have choice to some degree or another.
2 - Recognize that this choice exists in a space between stimulus and response.
3 - Accept that true Self-Awareness is required to successfully live our lives.
4 - Only by living by principals can we truely be the drivers of our lives.

Item number 1 - Relaize that we always have a choice to some degree or another.
How many of you are familiar with the book 7 habits of highly effective people bySteven Covey?

(pause)

Covey tells a story about a man named Victor Frankl. A Jewish psychyatrist that ended up in a Nazi death camp. This man went through some pretty horrendous experiences, but at the heart of it realized that he had a limitless amount of freedom in his own mind.  While the Nazis had full control over his environment and body, they simply had no control over his mind.  While this is an extreme example, it is amazing to learn of some one that could find this incredible freedom in such a difficult circumstance.  I find that the most difficult choices I run into on a daily basis, typically involve how much I'm going to complain about doing the dishes.

Item 2 - Recognize that choie exists in a space between stimuls and response.

Covey describes that one of the main distictions between human beings and animals is that Humans have a set of abilities that exist between stimuls and response - We have Self awareness, imagination, conscionse and independent will.  With these items combined, we are able to see ourselves and identify our values, come up with a creative way to atain them, temper our plans with our conscience, then proceed by our own desire to do so.

This is concept is deeply meaningful  to me.  The realization that I have an infinite amount of time, space and power between stimuls and response is so enabling and brings me so much happiness. I can feel my eyes go wide as  Iconsider the posiblities.

Item 3 - Accept that true selfawareness is required to be successful in our lives.

The next time you look in a mirror, turn off the judging portion of your brain completely. Allow yourself to truly see that person staring back at you.  You will find things that you love, and you will find things that you don't love so much. Fully see every aspect of your life. Let each thought be cradled in patience and kindness. Your mind is programmed to categorize, judge and survive. recognize it happening, but don't let those low level mental activities decide who you are. Instead, see those things about you that you need to accept and those you can change, then make a plan based on principles.

This brings me to item  4 - Only by living by principals can we truely be the drivers of our lives.
 - Using our selfawareness, imagination, conscience, independt will
 - select principals that mean something to us.
 - Reality is messy, uncontrolled, unexpected, down-right rude.
 - Relaity will threaten our plans, but principals are what reality is made of so isn't affected by the chaos.

To attain the drivers seat in our life, we must recognize that we have choice, and can use our uniquely human talents to then carefully choose our responses from any stimulus. We must see ourselves with a combination of raw honesty yet gentle kindness, we can choose those principles that will be the foundation of who we decide to be.
