Make three copies of sept poster stuff.

(have bro mecham  cut out sept poster stuff)

Cna any one tell me what a law or a rule is? 

Explain that just as we have rules at home, at school,and in Primary, we have rules for our town and country.These rules are called laws. Laws help and protect usjust like our home, school, and Primary rules do. Tell astory about a child who learned how laws protect andhelp us when we obey them. Use the story below orcreate one of your own:

Jerry had always wanted a dog of his own, so he wasexcited when he was given a beautiful puppy for hisbirthday. He named the dog Pal. Jerry and Pal had a lotof fun together.

Jerry’s city had a law that said all dogs must be onleashes when they were not in a fenced yard. One dayJerry decided to take Pal with him to a friend’s house.He could not find Pal’s leash, and his friend only lived afew houses away, so Jerry decided to take Pal withoutthe leash.

As they walked down the street, Pal saw a cat on theother side of the road. Before Jerry realized what washappening, Pal ran into the road and was hit by a car.

With tears in his eyes, Jerry picked up the dog andcarried him home. Jerry’s mother took them to theveterinarian, who took care of Pal’s broken leg.

When they got home, Jerry’s mother told him that Palcould have been killed. Jerry realized that if he hadobeyed the law and kept his dog on a leash, Pal wouldnot have been hurt. Jerry realized that the law wasthere to protect him and his dog, and he decided hewould never disobey that law again.

	Why do you think Jerry’s city had a law about keeping dogs on leashes?
	

* •
	
	How could Pal’s accident have been prevented?

	Why do we have laws and rules that we must follow?
	

There's a few different kinds of laws and rules - the first one is the law of a City.  Is it ok for me to drive my car on the grass at the park? they're probably not going to b ehappy about it. Can anyone think of a law in a City? What about driving? Can I drive however I want? Do I hae to drive on the correct side of the roarD?

Let me show you some street signs for driving - do you gusy know some of these?

(SHOW SIGNS)

So are rules important?

"Bro Mecham, Lets Play tic tac toe"

Play messed up tic-tac-to with bro Mecham.

K - what was wrong with that game?

Does some one know how to play ticktactoe the right way?  How do you play it? What did we do wrong?

K - now we'll play it with rules.

What was different? Were we actually able to play the game?

Did these rules help us play the game?

Can some one tell me a rule that you have at school?

does heavenly father want us to obey the Law?  why does he care about the law?

Can any one tell me the twelth article of faith?

We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.
What does being subject mean? being subject menas being willing to obey what the rulesr of our land want us to do. what does sustainting mean? It means to support a law, make sure that we help ensure the law stays put and follow it.

Do you guys know what taxes are? are you supposed to pay them?
Mathew 22:15 - The pharisees were always trying to get Jesus to say something that went against other things he had said .

 15 ¶Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in _his_ talk.

 16 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any _man:_ for thou regardest not the person of men.

 17 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar, or not?

 18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Whytempt ye me, _ye_ hypocrites?

 19 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.

 20 And he saith unto them, Whose _is_ this image and superscription?

 21 They say unto him, Cæsar’s. Then saith he unto them,Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.

 22 When they had heard _these words,_ they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.

Jesus saidpull out a coin - and it had Caesers face on it. And he was essentially saying, that The money was created by a law, and with that law came taxes, so they needed to pay taxes, and to return to ceaser that which was his, and return to God that which is Gods.

Ok - we're goin to play obey the law game.  pick som eone, you go first.  (wait for a moment,and see if he has confusion)

OH - did I forget to tell you the rules or Laws of the game?

I'm going to whisper something that (far right) has to do, to (far left), and we're going to see if you guys can sustain the law, and help make sure it gets followed.

I know that laws hav ebeen given to us to help define how we can have fun safe lives, and I"m geatful for them.

OK - lets finish the dya with working on our September poster.
