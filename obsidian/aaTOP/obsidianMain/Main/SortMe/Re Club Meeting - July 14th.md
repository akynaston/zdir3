# Re: Club Meeting - July 14th

All,

Thanks to Raylene, we have minutes today!  Thanks for doing this Raylene!  Have a great day everyone! FYI: I've updated the email list; please let me know if you see any changes are needed. Some people are listed with multiple email addresses, and we may not have everyone yet.

Minutes:

The meeting today was great! With perspicacity (the quality of having ready insight, or shrewdness)(Thank you Mary), Merrie called the meeting to order and also acted as Toastmaster. 

Attending were: Linda Black, Jill Tingey, Merrie Hudson, Michael Brooke, Dlayne Swensen, Dlayne's friend Courtney, Kevin Ford, Robert Miller, Rodney Bliss, Mary Hosford, Lon Lovett, Dan and Donalyn Wolfe, Roscoe Allen, Raylene Jorgenson, and our area Governor Mark \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Lon Lovett gave a very inspiring Ice Breaker speech, as he encouraged us to capture and follow our creativity, through the examples of great photos he has taken in his journeys. With creative eyes, a patience for achieving the photos, he showed us what great wonders that can develop. Great speech!

Mark  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ gave a very insightful and helpful evaluation of Lon's speech. Lon is already a great speaker, Mark gave wonderful advice, as well.

Merrie presented Table Topics, with an interesting and fun twist. She asked the five participants to act as interviewers, each with a separate topic, as they pulled up their own participants from the audience, to question. We learned some great, and some fun, things about our fellow Toastmasters. Who knew Dlayne wants to be a full-body painter (joke ;-) )!    Linda and Roscoe tied in winning Table Topics.

Linda Black was presented by Mark as our new Area E Governor. The Area is in good hands, again!  She is replacing the out-going Roscoe Allen, who replaced Kim Dicou, who  replaced Susan Glenn (who replaced Emmy Jones after a few others in between).  Our club produces great leaders!

Announcements are:

1) Our club speech contest is coming soon. Plan now to participate!
2) Sept. 26th is the Area Speech Contest, with the club winners competing. It will be in the AF  Library at 10 am. Mark your calendars for a great experience watching and learning from great speakers.
3) Oct. 23, 24 is the District 15 Conference, in Elko, Nevada. Always filled with amazing and educational speakers, it will be well worth whatever it takes to attend!
4) If you would like to modify your involvement in these minutes report, please let me know; I've recently updated the email recipient list.
