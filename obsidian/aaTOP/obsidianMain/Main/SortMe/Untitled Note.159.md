Holly school sis and missing math assignments
It is so nice to be back in school!  We started off the week strong.  We are working really hard on multiplication facts.  Please help your child pick which facts they would like to work on and help them practice at home.  I let them choose which facts they try to pass off each day.
We are also getting ready for testing (believe it or not)!   We will be taking the state writing test in February.  We are writing informational and opinion papers.  We went into the computer lab on Friday so students could type their papers, and they really seemed to like it.  It would really help if they could practice typing at home if you have a computer they could use.  I know there are a few typing games they can play if you click on this link: <http://resources.nebo.edu/links>.
The end of the term is this Friday.  I am including a link to your Student Summary.  If there are any math assignments that your child is missing, please go to <http://connected.mcgraw-hill.com/>.  The username and password are both "nsd" followed by your student's lunch number.  For example, nsd12345.  Here you can login and print out the assignments your child is missing.  Please get them to me by Thursday for them to count.
SEPs are this Wednesday.  I will be sending home a reminder of when you signed up to come in and visit with me.  I am excited to share the growth I have seen in your child this year.
There will not be school on Friday, January 16th, or Monday, January 19th.  Enjoy another long weekend!
