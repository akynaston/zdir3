To Regain Root After NK2 Update:

1\. If already updated proceed to next step, otherwise you will need to be sure you are fully stock NI2 unrooted with safestrap uninstalled (If you are not there you will need to ODIN back to NI2 stock)
2\. Once on NI2 stock, accept the NK2 update (confirm all is working)
3\. Flash The NCG stock kernel via Odin (after flashing the kernel your device will crash and hang alot you will need to do your best to push through to the next step)

4\. Root using Towelroot
5\. Install SuperSU, open the app and allow it to update binaries normally
6\. Flash NK2 kernel via ODIN
7\. Reboot and Enjoy
