Speech #6
Situation with girl singing on stage.

I did not stand.  

I am an expert at detecting missed opportunity.  Today I stand here to tell you grab every moment and hold on to it as if it were a pile of gold.  Be wise. Stand for what you believe to be right.

Sitting in a school assembly, we were notified that we would be enjoying a ""talent"" show. To be clear, I put quotes around talents - a tant show really is a misnomer. I should have been called - a things-that-I-wish-I-were-awesome-at-but-havent-quite-got-it-yet show.

A very nerverous girl got on the stage.  She seemed dressed to go to a ball like Cinderella, and had a facial expressoin that she was about to loose her lunch in front of the entire school population.  I immediately felt nervoius for her, automatically hoping that she could get through this without falling apart.  Unfortunately, this did not happen.  

Background music begain playing, and I realized in shock that she was going to sing. I don't know about you, but when I am nevrous, singing is an imposibilty. She brought up the microphone and began to sing.  Two things were immediately apparent.  She had worked desparetely to be prepared and ready for this talent show. She had put in hours of time and effort to put on her best performance in front of a massive audience.  Today was not the day.  

As she continued singing, I could tell that nerviousnouss and the bright lights, and thousands of eyes on her began to eat at her confidence. I could tell, that with just a little more polish, she could really have something going; but today, Her voice shook.  Her hands tremembeld.  Her voice wavered, off pitch enough to be painful for both her and the uadience. And then it happened.  A boy somehwere in the audience began to howl like a dog.

My heart sank.

I imagine if I were sitting on the space station in orbot around the earth, and some one suddenty opened a hatch to welcome in the vaccumm of space, this is how I felt. The girl on stage continued a moment longer, though now with competention from this hateful boy in the audience.  A moment later, she failed completely, already soaked in tears, and was running off of the stage.

10 seconds later, Well after the horrible event, a frustration so deep and forceful appeared in the center of my soul. I was surprised to see that my seat hadn't burst in to flames yet, because I was furious. What a rediculous display of childish judgement and plain meanness./.
