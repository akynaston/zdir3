# WarCraft: How you should speak to your management

Glen, Huston,

I've Evernoted this for maximum sharability; please pass this on to your son. I'm sure if he uses these regularly his humility will increase by 30%! Check your volume before clicking :-)

This is what you should say when you come in in the morning:
<http://www.thanatosrealms.com/war2/sounds/orcs/peon/ready.wav>

You can choose any of these to say after Glen gives you a task:
(The first one is my favorite)
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/phgbn3is0kombj1/YeshMiLord.wav>
<http://www.thanatosrealms.com/war2/sounds/orcs/ogre-mage/acknowledge1.wav>
<http://www.thanatosrealms.com/war2/sounds/orcs/death-knight/acknowledge1.wav>

When you are done, with your assigned task, say this:
<http://www.thanatosrealms.com/war2/sounds/orcs/basic-orc-voices/work-complete.wav>

If Glen gives you a task that makes you uncomfortable, say one of these:
<http://www.thanatosrealms.com/war2/sounds/orcs/basic-orc-voices/annoyed6.wav>
<http://www.thanatosrealms.com/war2/sounds/orcs/basic-orc-voices/annoyed5.wav>

Enjoy :-)
