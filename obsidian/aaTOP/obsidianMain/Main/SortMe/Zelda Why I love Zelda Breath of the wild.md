# [Zelda] Why I love Zelda Breath of the wild.

\[Zelda\] Why I love Zelda Breath of the wild.

I should hate this game

* I hate games where you have to cook.
* I hate breakable weapons. 
* I want skill trees. 

Still Zelda is filled with amazing moments that made me smile.

* * *

Once I shot down bee hive and the enemies all ran away without their weapons. So I went in and beat them all to death. 

I set a bunch of brush on fire and all the enemies came running out without their wepons :)

Shot a bunch of explosive barrels in a skull and killed everyone inside :)

**Favorite Moment :)**
Just before leaving the Great Plateau - I was trying to climb a cliff to get a Korok seed, but it was raining and so I couldn’t climb (slick when wet). So I turned around and just started flying off the cliff with my glider. I saw a gigantic sleeping Cyclops. As I flew over him, I noticed his neck was sparkling. He was sleeping so I slowly brought my glider above him and landed on his chest. Then I picked the items off his neck while he was sleeping! They were high level weapons on his neckless! ahahah Normally you have to kill him to get the weapons. But I didn’t have to! I was totally in an area where I am too weak to be there, but the game rewareded me for trying something new and crazy.

Then I jumped off the Hinox because he was waking up. He kills me in one hit so I ran off :) I ran down a bridge. A high level enemy rushed me with his horse. I head shotted him with an arrow and he flew off his horse and off a bridge into the water. The horse ran past me and I jumped on. Then I rode through his camp on HIS horse shooting his pals. SO COOL Felt like an action movie! A bunch of fun surprises all in a row.

Found a wolf, held a bunch of fish to see if I could feed him.... He killed me.

Climbed up on this big bridge in a desert canyon. A high level guy I couldn't kill charged me. I blew him off the ledge with a Korok leaf :)

* * *

Did a shrine in the village. Found a kid saying Mom will find him soon.

Followed a path and found some farries, sneaking flowers, and big fary who can upgrade cloths :)

* * *

Found a super scary dude with a fire face and fire wand. He killed me instantly. I went back and shot him in the face with my bow several times and slammed the jerk :)

* * *

I snuck into an encampment and I was watching them from behind a box. I started throwing bombs but they still didn't see me. They all walked up to the bomb to see what it was. Then I made them all explode. (One of my favorite ways to attack). I had to do this for a long time because bombs don’t do a ton of damage. They still couldn't see me so I kept throwing bombs.

One guy was looking my direction for me. He didn't realize he was standing **two close to the fire** so he totally lit on fire ahahah. :) His weapon lit on fire, then he started on fire and he totally burned to death!  I didn't know they could light themselves on fire by accident lol.

Found a shrine way out in the ocean. Couldn't fly there. 
Looked and saw a huge mountain that looks over the shrine. I climbed up there and flew into the shrine from way far away. Great sunsets

Zelda

* I killed a giant Guardian with my giant horse.
	* I rode around him till all his legs broke off. Then I charged him and knocked him on his side.
	* He was stuck there on his side.
	* Then I beat on him with low level weapons.
* I killed Hinox by charging him.
	* It took like 15 times. He is slow so I kept circling and smacking him.
* I got my horse across a river to Zoram's home.
	* Started up sirens path. Can't climb. They roll rocks at you. I got big horse on trail by climbing down from a high place. 
* Then the rocks they rolled didn't hurt us. 
* I trampled them. I climbed over trail. Got to apartwhereocouldnt cross and cut s bunch of trees then crossed kntree!!!!  Ahahahsh

* * *

I cut some trees down to get my horse into an area where you are not supposed to have a horse. It came in really handy when I had to run past a bunch of enemies. :)
