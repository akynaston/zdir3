# Job opening

Shane,

Would you be able to send this out to the elders?

At the most simple level, we're looking for some one that likes to work with computers and clients, doesn't mind a little travel (I've traveled 8 times in the 7 years I've been here), can learn to do things a different way; so essentially nearly any resume would be accepted.

Here are some bullet points to try and help narrow down possible candidates:

 - Our office is in Lehi, so there is a bit of a commute (40 minutes from Santaquin)

 - We would also accept interns.

 - Having experience with Novell products would be a big plus, like eDirectory, Identity Manager, Access Manager, etc.

 - Some knowledge of the following would be helpful but is not required:

    - Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, HTML (and web servers) PHP, really any programming experience would be helpful.

 - Experience being a project manager of any kind would be helpful.

 - Experience in sales would also be helpful.

 - Beginning salary would be competitive.

If you are interested in applying for this job, please provide an updated resume to [akynaston@trivir.com](mailto:akynaston@trivir.com).  Please review resources for writing a good resume:
