# Note conflict 7 Habits Moment for JUne 20, 2016

7 Habits Moment
     - June 20
     - I think I could come up with a story for every habit where Ive become convinced that it was a great idea.
     but the one I wanted to focus on is Habit 4, win-win. In the 7 habits book, they mention how our world is really strongly in a win-lose mentality, that for soem reason, there walways has to be someone that has to lose to move forwward. I've lvoed to hear that there is a better way.   the idea that not only is it ok, but even more ideal to find a way where all parties involved can somehow benefit from an arrangement.
     - I've been in Toastmasters now for almost a year an half, and it's been incredible to take habit 4 with me into those meetings. I've found the people there to be not only be really intelligent, but they have a genuine care for me to succeed as a public speaker and leader. With their help, I've found a major fear of mine is actually a passion.  I love to get in front of people now and talk about anything from a great story to a life changing experience, just like I"m doing now.
        IT's been fun to be asked to give evalualtions to people that have years more experience than me, and to find that they have agreed and have benefited from my toung tied thoughts.
     To truely be part of organizatoins that geneually care about your success has been very enjoyable.
        As I've moved from job to job growing up, I never felt that I would feel like I was more than an  toaster at quite a few of my previous jobs. I did atain the rank of advanced toaster at a few of them, but still wasn't seen as more than an entry on a payroll.
     Being at TriVir there's been this string sense of win-win in every relationship - between us as employees, and with our clients. I've enjoyed conversations where we're talking bout how a client would benefit even more from something if we changed the way we resolved a problem, yet at the same time, it quite often ends up with them paying more money and they are happier than when they were before.
     So that's what I wanted to add - seems appropriate to add a challenge here - If you haven't seen the power of win-win, make a conscious effort in your work and personal lives: people will see that you genuinely care.
     So Enjoy :-)
