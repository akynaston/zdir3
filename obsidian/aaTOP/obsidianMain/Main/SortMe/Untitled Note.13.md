ss Lesson - 7/18/2021 9:44:28 AM
SS Lesson (last?)

Hey everyone! As you know we don't have much time in here; but I do want to start with asking you guys how our week was.  Any one do anything fun? any o fyou getting read for school a month early?  Walmart seems to alwasy be a month ahead, lot sof school stuff out now.

LIke we talked about on our first day, we need to be worthy and ready to receive personal revelation. This is one reason why I love the D&C so much - it's just revelation after reveleation; some directed to specific people, some to the church as a whole; and all of it is applicable to all of us.

This lesson covers 4 sections, and all of them are reveleations of different categories. All o them powerful It reminded me about something that you may have heard about already in a previous lesson, or in your own reading - there's a time where Joseph and Sydney in a grou of about 12 people are in a room together; yet only two o them see a vision; while the others sense only the power. Joseph and Sydney kinda narrate it to each other just to see if they're seeing the same thing. and find that they are.
    When the vision is over Sidney is al pale and run down - here's how it says it in the manual:

**“Joseph sat firmly and calmly all the time in the midst of a magnificent glory, but Sidney sat limp and pale, apparently as limber as a rag, observing which, Joseph remarked, smilingly, ‘Sidney is not used to it as I am’” (in “Recollections of the Prophet Joseph Smith,”** _**Juvenile Instructor,**_ **May 1892, 303–4).**

**![[./_resources/Untitled_Note.13.resources/church_history_johnson_home.jpg]]**

I love how the visions for Joseph became some commonplace, and he had practiced being in the spirit so much that he could deal with it; and knew the feeling well.  Joseph had to go through the same practice of holding that much of the spirit.

So just a quick over view - our lesson is over sections 77 through 80.

It starts out in 77 and 78 that are kinda on two ends of the reelvation spectrum - 77 is full of revelation about spirtiual matters from the book of revelation, where 78 is a reelvation about physical matters.

77 - happens in March 1832 when Joseph smith is translating the bible.
    He has a series of questions and answers written down.  lot of it is still over my head; but it is interesting to see the question and answer format.

78 - put together an organization to build and maintain a storehouse. It talks about people having an equality of physical possessions - to enable equality in receiving heavenly things.

79 - Very short mission call to Jared Carter. has some interesting points we'll hit in a sec.

80 - another mission call to Two others, only one vers longer; again has some cool things in it we'll cover.

Back to 77 - This questoin an answer session in this section, is when Joseph is asking questions about the book of revelation.  Some of the answers to me are as complicated as the question; but I love the frank quesiton and answer format. Some of the answers are quite interesting.
    Do you guy shave scriptures? Please bring them.
     - version 1 - What is the sea of

**1** Q. What is the [a](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note1a)[sea](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note1a) of glass spoken of by John, [4th chapter, and 6th verse of the Revelation](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/4.6?lang=eng#p6)?
A. It is the [b](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note1b)[earth](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note1b), in its [c](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note1c)[sanctified](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note1c), [d](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note1d)[immortal](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note1d), and [e](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note1e)[eternal](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note1e) state.

See of glass - sounds kinda cool. Of course, these are just words in our broken silly langugage, and are really just sign post to try and describe something tmaazing. Living on a sea of glass sounds trippy.

Next one in verse 4:

**4** Q. What are we to understand by the [a](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note4a)[eyes](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note4a) and [b](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note4b)[wings](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note4b), which the beasts had?
A. Their eyes are a representation of light and knowledge, that is, they are full of [c](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note4c)[knowledge](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note4c); and their wings are a [d](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note4d)[representation](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note4d) of [e](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note4e)[power](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note4e), to move, to act, etc.

Very powerful

**8** Q. What are we to understand by the four [a](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note8a)[angels](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note8a), spoken of in the [7th chapter and 1st verse of Revelation](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/7.1?lang=eng#p1)?
A. We are to understand that they are four angels sent forth from God, to whom is given power over the four parts of the earth, to save life and to destroy; these are they who have the [b](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note8b)[everlasting gospel](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note8b) to commit to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; having power to [c](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note8c)[shut up](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note8c) the heavens, to seal up unto life, or to cast down to the [d](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note8d)[regions](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note8d) of darkness.

Ehss - pretty crazy - time clean up our act and be on the good side of things.

**12** Q. What are we to understand by the sounding of the [a](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note12a)[trumpets](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note12a), mentioned in the [8th chapter of Revelation](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/8?lang=eng)?
A. We are to understand that as God [b](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note12b)[made](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note12b) the world in six days, and on the seventh day he finished his work, and [c](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note12c)[sanctified](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note12c) it, and also formed man out of the [d](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note12d)[dust](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note12d) of the earth, even so, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years will the Lord God [e](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note12e)[sanctify](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note12e) the earth, and complete the salvation of man, and [f](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note12f)[judge](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note12f) all things, and shall [g](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note12g)[redeem](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note12g) all things, except that which he hath not put into his power, when he shall have sealed all things, unto the end of all things; and the sounding of the trumpets of the seven angels are the preparing and finishing of his work, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years—the [h](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note12h)[preparing](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note12h) of the way before the time of his coming.

\=====================================
Then later in section 78; we move on to phyiscal matters. God knows very well that we have phsyical as well as siritual needs. Are all of you famliliar with Maslos Hiearchy of needs? It's a decent explaination of our needs - if we're starving, it's hard to move on to more complicated ideas or thoughts about God.

78 - more data:
This is an interesting idea, I had always seen the storehouse as a way to keep peple from starving. As a child my momand dad got divorced, and we benefited a great deal at times from he storehouse more than once; so I have a direct appreciation for the idea. the point though, is that needs are met so that we can build on more and more meaningful and purposeful ideas.

3 - talk sabout the organization of the storehouse, that it needs to be done.

The next few versus talk about having needs met so that there can be an equality among us.

Then down in verses 17-19, there seems to be a sense and need to say why the storehouse is needed:

**17** Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye are [a](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note17a)[little children](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note17a), and ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and prepared for you;
**18** And ye cannot [a](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note18a)[bear](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note18a) all things now; nevertheless, be of good [b](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note18b)[cheer](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note18b), for I will [lead](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note18c) you along. The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours, and the [riches](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note18d) of [e](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note18e)[eternity](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note18e) are yours.
**19** And he who receiveth all things with [a](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note19a)[thankfulness](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note19a) shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an [b](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note19b)[hundred fold](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note19b), yea, more.

It's like he's saying, lets get rid of the silly probems of the earth, so we can move on to the real stuff; though the silly probelms are there to help us to learn to work and strive from the beginning. Just to say alive we have to work a great deal.

\========================================================
So now, on to 79 and 80.

79 0 only 4 version.
79 is the mission call to a guy named Jared Carter - interesting - says he's caled to the eastern countries, from place to place and city to city, using the Comforter to know where to go.  How would that be to receive a mission call that says - you just get packed up and go, then I'll tell you whats going on. Great deal of faith in a request like this.

80 -Stepen burnett, and his companion eden smith - says in verse 3:
**3** Wherefore, go ye and preach my gospel, whether to the north or to the south, to the east or to the west, it mattereth not, for ye cannot go amiss.

pack you bags and go buddy!

IN version 4 it says **4** Therefore, declare the things which ye have heard, and verily believe, and [a](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note4a)[know](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note4a) to be true.  reveleation based on a alikely alread strong testimny.

**5** Behold, this is the will of him who hath [a](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note5a)[called](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note5a) you, your Redeemer, even Jesus Christ. Amen.

almost like a reminder on the call where it came from.

Love how powerful these revelations are.  Revelation is a funny thing too; how it can be so specific and exact, yet at other times it's just a huge push to be faitful.
\========================================================

My favorite kind of revelation is the stuff I'm givine as a father for my kids.  I yell enough that my kids may not know it, but there has been many times, where the spirit will step in and tell me what to say, but mos tof the time, it says keep our trap shut, they understand; give them time and be patient.  I can see how much God my kids - What a blessing this is.

I see my kids quite litertally in a new light; as if I can see the more clearly, it is a deeply humbling experience to be responsble for thier lives.

I'm greatful to be here and work to teach you. I know my brain can be scrambeled but it's quite cool to talk about reveleation with others. I know God lives and whats to bless us with knoweldge and power.
I say this in the name Jesus Christ Amen.
