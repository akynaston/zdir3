# Re: Thanks!

I've been thinking about this a bit more lately - It's funny how the idea of creating my own truth irritates and satisfies me so much at the same time.  It seems totally right and yet at the same time it still bothers me.

Brandon Sanderson has been fun to read a lot lately; because he has people in his books that believe all kinds of crazy things; yet you and I know that they hold on to what they've defined as truth with all of the heart.

I'm quite excited to come up with my own religions in my own book, and see how my characters try resolve this unknown gap between absolute and created truth!!
