# STown

First I have to say, I don't know that I have the same contexnt you do, but I have to believe that Tyler found the gold. Too bad 

Really kinda of a weird start to a relationship: a rumor of a murder that didn't happen? interesting. 

* John just lonely and bored?
* Odd cry for help?

Mixture of music in the pod cast felt really effective and appropriate, especially the rose for emily by the zombies, and the opera music; which I think was JOhn's mother's favorite?

Rose For Emily was very well placed: article about the choice:

When I heard that John committed suicide I just about cried; sounded like a really unique cool dude. Then to hear that he commited 

One year later article:

Tyler says he didn't find the gold; or else he wouldn't be in Stown any more.
