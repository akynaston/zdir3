Primary 6 Lesson 38
<https://www.lds.org/manual/primary-6-old-testament/lesson-38?lang=eng>
Esther saves her people.

Opening prayer

Have any of you seen a popsicle stick bomb? I want to show you how cool it is; if we cna get through the lesson, I'll show it to you.

Can Some tell me what it means to fast? I have a cool story to tell you, complete with a proud king, dethroning a queen, and a murder plot.

There was a King named Ahasueras.  He had lots of gold and silver and a lot of beautiful linens - or material and he wanted the whole city to see.  so he held a 7 day feast.

* At the end of the feast - Tried to display Vashti.
* She didn't want to come. Do yo uknow why?
	* (she didn't want to come to a room of people that had been eating and drinking for 7 days)
* How do you think the King responded?
* The king asked his wisemen what he should do; and they recommended that they dethrone her! and pick a new queen!
* he commanded that all the beautiful women in the kingdom were brought to him to select a new queen.

There was another guy named Mordecai

* How was Esther related to Mordecai? ([Esther 2:5, 7](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/2.5%2C7?lang=eng#4).)
	* **5** ¶ Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;
		**7** And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid wasfair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.
		
* Why were the Jews living in Persia? ([Esther 2:6](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/2.6?lang=eng#5). Explain that the Jews were Heavenly Father’s covenant people. This means that they had promised to obey the Lord. They were also one of the tribes of Israel; in other words, they were descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But they had been conquered and taken to the lands of Media and Persia.)
	* **6** Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
* When Esther was taken to the king’s palace, why didn’t she let anyone know she was a Jew? ([Esther 2:10, 20](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/2.10%2C20?lang=eng#9).
	* **10** Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.
	* **20** Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.
* What happened when Esther was first presented to the king? ([Esther 2:17](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/2.17?lang=eng#16).)
	* **17** And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.

* What did Mordecai do to protect the king? ([Esther 2:21–23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/2.21-23?lang=eng#20).) Explain that Bigthan and Teresh were part of the king’s personal guard. Their plot to kill the king was especially dangerous because they had many opportunities to be near him and could more easily carry out their plan.
	* **21** ¶ In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
		**22** And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai’s name.
		
		**23** And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.
		
* What reason did Mordecai give the people for not bowing to Haman, who held the highest position of all the king’s officials? ([Esther 3:2–4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/3.2-4?lang=eng#1).)
	* **2** And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.
		**3** Then the king’s servants, which were in the king’s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king’s commandment?
		
		**4** Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s matters would stand: for he had told them that he wasa Jew.
		
* Why did Mordecai refuse to bow to Haman? ([Exodus 20:3](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ex/20.3?lang=eng#2).
	* **3** Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
	* Explain that in addition to having the people bow to Haman, the king had also commanded them to reverence or worship him. If Mordecai had done this, he would have been breaking the first of the [Ten Commandments](http://www.mormon.org/beliefs/commandments).)

* What did the angry Haman try to do to punish Mordecai and the Jews? ([Esther 3:6, 8–9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/3.6%2C8-9?lang=eng#5).)
	* **6** And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.
		**8** ¶ And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it is not for the king’s profit to suffer them.
		
		**9** If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.
		
* How would you feel if a law were passed that all members of the Church were to be killed on a certain day? How did Mordecai and the Jews react to the new law? ([Esther 4:1–3](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/4.1-3?lang=eng#0).)
	* **1** When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
		**2** And came even before the king’s gate: for none might enter into the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.
		
		**3** And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
		
* Explain that sackcloth was a coarse fabric made of camel or goat hair and was worn while fasting or mourning. In addition to wearing sackcloth, the people either sat in piles of ashes or sprinkled ashes on themselves as a symbol that joy had left them.

* Why was Esther afraid to go to the king? ([Esther 4:11](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/4.11?lang=eng#10).) What did Mordecai tell her about going to the king? ([Esther 4:13–14](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/4.13-14?lang=eng#12).) Explain that Mordecai thought it possible that Heavenly Father had prepared Esther to save the Jews. What did Esther do so she could be successful in pleading with the king? ([Esther 4:16–17](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/4.16-17?lang=eng#15).) How did the king receive Esther? ([Esther 5:2–3](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/5.2-3?lang=eng#1).) What are some righteous things we might fast for? (See enrichment activity 4.)

* Esther requested a three-day fast. How long should we fast? Fasting usually means abstaining from food and drink for two consecutive meals, but President Joseph F. Smith stated that this “is not an absolute rule, … but it is left with the people as a matter of conscience, to exercise wisdom and discretion. Many are subject to weakness, others are in delicate health … ; of such it should not be required to fast” (_Gospel Doctrine_ \[1968\], p. 244).
* Whom did Esther ask to come to the banquet? ([Esther 5:4–5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/5.4-5?lang=eng#3).) What was Haman angry about after coming out of the first banquet? ([Esther 5:9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/5.9?lang=eng#8).) What did Haman’s friends and wife tell him to do about Mordecai? ([Esther 5:14](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/5.14?lang=eng#13).)
* How was the king reminded of Mordecai’s good deed in s aving his life? ([Esther 6:1–3](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/6.1-3?lang=eng#0).) Point out that it is possible that the king’s sleeplessness was a blessing from Heavenly Father as a result of the Jews’ fast. How did the king determine Mordecai’s reward? ([Esther 6:6–10](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/6.6-10?lang=eng#5).)
* What did Esther request of the king at the second banquet? ([Esther 7:3–4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/7.3-4?lang=eng#2).) What happened to Haman when the king discovered his plan to destroy the Jews? ([Esther 7:9–10](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/7.9-10?lang=eng#8).) What reward was given to Mordecai? ([Esther 8:1–2](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/8.1-2?lang=eng#0).)
* How should we fast? ([Matthew 6:16–18](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/6.16-18?lang=eng#15).) How can we better observe the fast? Explain that our fast should include sincere prayer. Point out that often we will also have a specific reason for our fast. We may not always receive the answer we desire, but we should have faith that the Lord’s will should be done. It is important to develop the habit of living the law of the fast so that when we have specific needs we will know how to receive help. Our fast should also give us a desire to help others.
* Why is fasting sometimes difficult? Help the children understand that they may experience feelings of hunger and thirst, but they can grow in spirituality as they continue to cheerfully obey the commandment to fast. What positive experiences have you had in fasting individually or with your families?

## Enrichment Activities

You may use one or more of the following activities any time during the lesson or as a review, summary, or challenge.

1. Role-play the events in the story from Esther (see [Esther 4:1–5:3](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/4.html?lang=eng&span=4:1-5:3)). Read the lines while the children act the parts or give copies of the lines to the children to read. You might give the children simple props or name tags to identify the characters.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Servant: | Mordecai, Queen Esther wonders why you are mourning in sackcloth and ashes. |
| Mordecai: | Haman has gained permission to have all the Jews killed, both young and old, little children and women. Give Esther a copy of the decree, and have her plead with the king for her people. |
| Servant: | Mordecai wants you to go to the king and plead for your people. |
| Esther: | Please take the message to Mordecai that I am afraid to go to the king without being called, for I will be killed unless the king holds out his golden scepter to me. The king has not requested to see me for thirty days, and I fear that I will displease him. |
| Servant: | (Hands a paper to Mordecai.) |
| Mordecai: | Tell Esther that she cannot escape death as a Jew just because she lives in the king’s house. I ask again for her to plead with the king for her people. Perhaps this is the very reason the Lord has permitted Esther to be queen—that she might save her people. |
| Servant: | Mordecai asks again that you plead for your people. |
| Esther: | Have Mordecai and the Jews fast for me for three days, night and day. My maidens and I will also fast. I will go before the king, and if I perish, I perish. |
| King: | (Raises scepter and smiles.) What do you want, Esther? I will give you what you want up to half of my kingdom. |

3. Make name cards for each of the following scripture characters: King Ahasuerus, Vashti, Mordecai, Esther, and Haman. Pin a card on the back of five children without showing them which one they have. Have them ask their classmates yes or no questions about the character to help them discover which person they are. You could repeat this activity if time permits.
	Questions might be similar to the following: Am I a Jew? Am I righteous? Did I fast? Was I friendly to Mordecai? Am I a queen?
	
4. Tell the following story in your own words:
	A group of Latter-day Saints in the early days of the Church lived in Mexico. Pancho Villa, a Mexican revolutionary commander, was raiding many settlements in northern Mexico. One of the settlements that was to be destroyed on a certain night was called Colonia Dublán, a Latter-day Saint settlement. The bishop of the ward in that town asked all the members to fast and pray. He called a meeting at the church for all the people. They prayed and were told to continue fasting and praying to Heavenly Father for protection from Pancho Villa and his army. They were then to go to bed as if it were any other night and trust that the Lord would watch over them.
	During the night when Pancho Villa’s army approached the town, they saw from a lookout what they thought were campfires of a large army protecting the town. Pancho Villa and his army rode off, thinking it would be unwise to attack Colonia Dublán.
	
5. List and discuss several things we might appropriately fast for. A possible list could include:
	To help our loved ones recover from an illness or injury
	To help us make important decisions
	To help us gain a testimony
	To help others be willing to hear the gospel
	To receive protection from evil
	To receive relief in time of natural disasters and droughts
	To help us feel the Spirit
	To prepare us to receive special blessings, such as a patriarchal blessing
	To show [gratitude](https://www.lds.org/topics/gratitude/) for our blessings
	To help us overcome sin
	To help us solve problems
	To help us know whom to share the gospel with
	To receive comfort when we mourn
	To help us understand or accomplish a difficult assignment
	To help others with their problems
	
6. Divide the class into two groups and give each group a piece of paper and a pencil. Have them make a list of all the qualities Esther exhibited as she saved her people from destruction. Some of the answers the children might think of are courage, trust in Heavenly Father, love for others, humility, and so on. Have the children share their lists of qualities with each other.
7. Sing or read the words to [“Faith”](https://www.lds.org/manual/primary-6-old-testament/lesson-38?lang=eng) (_Children’s Songbook,_ p. 96) or [“In Fasting We Approach Thee”](https://www.lds.org/manual/primary-6-old-testament/lesson-38?lang=eng) (_Hymns,_ no. 139).

## Conclusion

## Testimony

You may want to testify that as we sincerely fast and pray, our prayers will be answered and we can become closer to Heavenly Father. Help the children understand that there is also great power in fasting for others. Encourage the children to fast cheerfully and with a purpose.
