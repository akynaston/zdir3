Lesson 2: Jesus Christ Volunteered to Be Our Savior

Prayer
 - What is Jesus Christ's role in the plan of salvation, what in the world does he do for us?  Does he make cheese burgers? Does he do our homework?

He chose to be a our savior.   He chose this!!  is being a savior easy?  Have any of you seen one of these before? (pull out rubix cube).  Does this look pretty hard?  When Jesus Christ heard that a job had to be done he was looking at something like this.  Something very difficult needed to be taken care of.If you look at the instructoins on how to solve this, is it about 35 pages of pictures, and steps to very carefully follow to get it to be solved, so it's a lot of work.

What's a savior? some one that saves some one right?  If some one is getting saved, what is happening?  If some one is in a burindg building and they can't get out, do they ned some one to save them?  If os, what would that person do?

do we need to be saved? Saved from what?  I'm not in a burning building!  I'm not drowning, I'm doing just fine!  
We need to be saved from our sin!  do you think we all make mistakes in here? Do we need to be saved from our mistakes?  Yes, definately - this is what the savior is for.  

_Testify to the children that before we were born on earth we all lived withHeavenly Father as spirit children. Explain that our spirit bodies look likeour physical bodies, with arms, legs, eyes, and so on, but are not fleshand blood. Also explain that this life as spirit children is called premortallife. During this premortal life our heavenly parents taught us the gospeland the plan of life._

_You might share this quotation from Brigham Young: “You are wellacquainted with God our Heavenly Father. … There is not a soul of youbut what has lived in his house and dwelt with him. … There is not aperson here to-day but what is a son or a daughter of that Being”(Discourses of Brigham Young, p. 50)._

The savior did something called the atonement.  Can any one tell me what this is?  The atonemend made it possible for us to be back with Jesus again.   Was it easy?  Was it something that he just did without any effort?  NO!  This was very hard. He bled from every pore, and even asked god one point of there was any other way, but then said let thy whill be done, and he went through it.

Why in the world would the savior vounteer for something tos painful? If it is so difficult, so painful, and rought to go through, why would he choose it?

Who has their scritupres?
lets read John 15;13

 13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down hislife for his friends.

What does that mean?  it means that the most extreem way to show love for some one is to give up your life for them -= that's pretty drastic, we're not called on to give up our lives at the monment, but it is what Jesus did for us.  so why did Jesus give up his life for us?

Was there some one else that tried to be our savior?

Moses Chapter 4

 1 And I, the Lord God, spake unto Moses, saying: That Satan,whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten,is the same which was from the beginning, and he came beforeme, saying—Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and Iwill redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surelyI will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.

 2 But, behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved andChosen from the beginning, said unto me—Father, thy will bedone, and the glory be thine forever.

 3 Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and soughtto destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had givenhim, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by thepower of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be castdown;

 4 And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies,to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will,even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.

Yea, so we know that Satan exists and he tried to be the savior.  Why wasn't he chosen? We have to chose to be saved - we have to repent right?

The savior wanted to help us because of Love.  How can you tell some one loves you?  Really truely loves you?  

OK - now is my favorite part of the lesson, we are going to have you guys teach us.
      - What does Lucifer mean, and 

1. 1. 
	
	In the premortal life we were spirit children and lived with our heavenly parents ([Hebrews 12:9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/12.9?lang=eng#8)).
	

1. 3. 
	
	Lucifer, who became Satan, was also a spirit child of Heavenly Father.
	

* 4. 
	
	Heavenly Father called a meeting for all his spirit children. At this meeting he explained his plan for us to become like him. He told us that he wanted us to go to earth to get a physical body. He explained that on earth we would be tested to see if we would keep his commandments.
	
* 5. 
	
	At this meeting Heavenly Father also explained that on earth we would all sin and we would all die. Heavenly Father needed someone to be the Savior, to suffer for our sins, and to die for us so that we could be resurrected.
	
* 6. 
	
	Lucifer wanted Heavenly Father to change his plan. Lucifer said he would save everyone by taking away their freedom to choose, which would have made it impossible for us to make mistakes or be righteous. Lucifer also wanted all the honor ([Moses 4:1](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.1?lang=eng#0)).
	
* 7. 
	
	Because he loved us ([John 15:13](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/15.13?lang=eng#12)), Jesus volunteered to be our Savior. He wanted to follow Heavenly Father’s plan and give the glory to Heavenly Father ([Moses 4:2](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.2?lang=eng#1)).
	
* 8. 
	
	Heavenly Father chose Jesus to be our Savior. Lucifer was angry and rebelled against Heavenly Father ([Revelation 12:7–9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/12.7-9?lang=eng#6); [Moses 4:3–4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.3-4?lang=eng#2)).
	
* 9. 
	
	Heavenly Father’s spirit children had to decide whether to follow Jesus or Lucifer.
	
* 10. 
	
	One-third of Heavenly Father’s spirit children chose to follow Lucifer, and they were all cast out of heaven. Lucifer became Satan, and the spirits who followed him became evil spirits, who try to get us to do wrong things. These spirits who followed Satan did not receive physical bodies.
	
* 11. 
	
	All the spirits who chose Heavenly Father’s plan and followed Jesus in the premortal life have been or will be born on earth with physical bodies of flesh and blood.
	
* 12. 
	
	All the children in this classroom chose to follow Heavenly Father’s plan and have been born on earth with mortal bodies.
