Round table discussion by elder Holland
Take time to bear testimony. Live your self the doctrine of Christ, then share the testimony that follows.

Gospel is about removing selfishness and returning to God by the power of the atonement. I know I'm teaching the Lesson with spirit when I learn from what I say.

Sin is limiting in more than one way. Fist it casts a cloud of doubt and insecurity. The adversary  would have us be removed from our foundation of Christ. Second, sin is typically sin because of some form of selfishness. Selfishness brings nothing but misdirection and again blurring the focus from a foundation of Christ.

Eat with family... need oportunities to teach. Make meal time positive.

Seeing the gap between what we do and what we are. Teach doctrine unto change.
Invite to improve always.

Let them find answers. Instructer  role is ask good questions.
Elder Bednar example help them answer. Great question aksers. Don't bail out the boys.

Questions cause different answers. Bednar PhD course in how to use scriptures.

We are teaching people not lessons. Revelation requires better consistent living.
