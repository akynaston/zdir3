There was no one there besides the two of them.
Did you hear that singning?
Then finally the obvious occured to him.
Where you singing?  She didnt seem to hear him.
And what are yo udoing spying on eveyr one trying to get a little privacy? she said briskly.
Laithanb realized that he had intruded on her space, and started to apologize, but she cut him off.
It doesn't matter, I was leaving any way.
Now that Laithan had his wits about him again, he realized that she was quite pretty.   Not the kind of pretty that makes you forget your name, or get cold feet, more the kind of pretty flirtatious eyes and mouth that seem to always have a double meaning. She definately seemed irritated at the intrusion, but at the same time, she seemed to want company.  She stood, wiping pine needles and other debree from her pants.
My name's Tayra, what's yours? She said it with a disarming smile, so it took Laithin a moment to respond.
"I'm Lathain. You're not from Vey, are you.  What are you doing here?"  Laithin mentioned half to himself, then immediatley realized it came out wrong. "I mean . ." Laithin began weekly; again, Tayra saved him, but did not save his pride; she laughed a moment before responding.

(put something in here about her voice being reminicent of the song)
"It's fine.  I'm with the entertainment (come up with grou nmae here) for Vey," she replied easily.
"Why haven't I ever seen you? Have you been with them for long?"
"No,(need city name, history where she came from), I've been working with them for only a week or two.  I was performing in Currant, they heard me performing, and wnated me to be part of the goup."
"So you sing professionally then?" Laithin asked stupidly again.  He was racking up quite a score card.
"Yes."
