it is good for us to be here.  baptized when was 18. went on mission one year later!!  others were an example to him because they went with elders.

(thus refers to self awareness)

Ht companion of Michael Swan
speaking of example of mike.
we have to CLAIM our blessings!!!  let's go.get um!!! we aren't going to be pushed into heaven.
Alow people to meet Christ when they meet us.
CONVERTED! not just check boxes.
calm self awareness alows us to set goals - we define who we are and cease to be victums. we make our choices out of deep seeded love and conversion.
we can't give our selves blessings. it's meant to be shared.
God wants the gospel to be so individual- he wants it to be burned into our sleves and become part of our lives instead of some outward cycles of meaningless actions. God is a being of purpose why not put purpose in our own lives? evev activities that consist of doing nothin can be filled with deep purpose and be alingned with personal vision.
mantra.  I am here.  I will create no more pain.
search for princepals. tigtly packages truth. separate it from the suroinding text and thughts.
Leah and I need to create a family shared vision. we currently hold only some basic vague feelings for what we want EACH OYHER TO DO!! a vision should be deeply atached to our souls.
things become calm and peaceful as our visions become closer to our selves - not because our life situation changes but because we see it completely differently, wig hope, trust suceed becomes the only outcome.
man singing did you think to pray
prayer causes 1 of 2 results either we check box it, or be one more self aware. when we talk to God all mind identified thoughts fall apart if were really there.
bro foster high c 15th ward
which horse are you?  three horses
dc 107 99 & 100. slothfull
dc 58. 26&29 compelled and slothfull the same is dammed intent is the inoly thig that matters!!
1 nephi 3:7
1 horse the sow beautiful but would bite you rough gated. the only horse they rode spurs with. couldn't explain hole between our eyes. had to be forced to do any thing but eat.
2 horse Fred. good horse obeyed, a steady horse.
3 horse old spot. spot knew it was an emergency ran by choice.
we are purposefully not commanded in all things. thus is is a negates way of commanding us to define a vision. if we don't have commandments to do what we need to do in each situation were do we get the dayly acions?? from our most chrished principals.
