### Disclaimer

Please [read the note from our friends in legal](http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/tools/disclaimer.html) before using this file.

### Details

The zip file contains the Java source, supporting files, and documentation for the Password Expiration Notification solution currently used by Novell IS&T.

This Java console application checks users in an LDAP directory and sends notification email messages when their password is about to expire. The application is scheduled to run nightly. Only those users whose passwords will be expiring in a specified number of days will be notified.

A configuration XML document defines the LDAP connection information, day intervals for notification and the email message templates for each interval. For example, users who will be expiring in 30 days may receive a different email message than those expiring tomorrow. The email messages are designed to be readable in both HTML and text-only views.

**Dependencies**

**Expiration Notification has the following dependencies:**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| config.xml | configuration document |
| OS task scheduler | the application must be scheduled to run every 24 hours |
| service account | LDAP user with read access to password related attributes |
| Classpath | Include mail.jar, activation.jar and jsse.jar in the Java classpath |

**Security**

No passwords are hard-coded in this application. The LDAP connection password is retrieved from the configuration document. It is assumed that the configuration document is protected from unauthorized access by the file system. A service account with read access to password related attributes is required.

**5-18-05 Update**

There was a bug in the code and an error in the sample config.xml :(
Sorry about that. This update should take care of many of the reported problems.

I also added the ability to run the application in console mode (no GUI) for those who are having trouble with X-Windows on Linux. I updated the instruction document to reflect these changes.

**5-19-05 Update**

I added a shell script to help Linux users run the app correctly.

#### Reader Comments

* I tried this ages ago and it was great. But now I have the Can't open config.xml file problem and I am unable to resolve it
* Found a better tool - Password Reminder PRO from SysOp Tools http://www.sysoptools.com - has a ton of reporting etc, and works right out of the box. Well done.
* Util doesn't work. I get an error on the server that config.xml can't be opened. I didn't change anything but the user, e-mail addresses, and context.
* Great tool - especially for our users who use GroupWise with POP/IMAP - always were confronted with expired passowrds.
* Again, fantstic! would love to see this reporting funcitonality also warn of account expiries and 'not logged in for x days account wil be deteled' too Paul F.
* Only works when password expires the same day.
* throws errors as a result of jar/libs that are needed: Connecting to Loyola Searching context: o=Loyola java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory not found in \[file:./lib/ExpirationNotification.jar, file:./lib/mail.jar, file:./lib/jsse.jar, file:./lib/activation.jar, file:/usr/share/java/libgcj-3.4.3.jar, file:./, core:/\]
* good tool... but would love to see support for Universal Password.
* Nice tool....would be nice to have LDAP Port as part of config as well...I'm no java programmer, so can't do this myself...
* Runs great on Linux, has problem of not notifying until PW expired on Windows.
* We got error:"can't open config.xml" until I moved it to the root of sys. After that it worked great!
* For those who get 'can't find config.xml' message or feel that the tool only works if the config.xml is placed in the root of the sys volume, just amend the CWD environment variable using the special netware commandline option -env. Hence java -envCWD=sys:system\\ExpirationNotification -classpath.............. work just fine.
* For those who want to make this tool work with Universal Password, just install the Security Services 2.0.1 update http://download.novell.com/Download?buildid=SLsf-fDRDUY~
