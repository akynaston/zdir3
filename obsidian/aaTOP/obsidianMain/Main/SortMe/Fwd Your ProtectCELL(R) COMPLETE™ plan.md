Dear Aaron Kynaston,

You purchased a **Protect**CELL **COMPLETE**TM plan at Protect Cell. Smart move! **Protect**CELL® offers real protection you can count on. Thanks for going with us.

Be sure to look out for a separate email containing your user name and password. When you get it, sign in at [protectcell.com](http://www.protectcell.com/My-Plan.aspx), pick the **Protect**CELL plan features and benefits you want to take advantage of and have a look at all that's waiting for you at the site.

**Electronic crashes, physical smashes, liquid splashes… No matter what it is or when it happens, we’ll get you another device fast.** All you have to do is call our industry-leading call center located right here in the good ol’ U.S. at [[tel:877.775.3274|877.775.3274]]. Or, you can log into your account at ProtectCELL.com, and select “Request” from the side menu.

**The fear of losing irreplaceable data stored in mobile devices keeps some people up at night.** But not YOU, because your backup will be safe with us. Rest assured knowing your contacts, texts, events, photo memories--you name it-- are protected. What if your worst nightmare comes true and you misplace your device? Now you can locate and lock it, and if necessary, erase your personal info. To get started, make sure you activate this feature when logged into [protectcell.com](http://www.protectcell.com/My-Plan.aspx).

**It’s no fun watching a perfectly good phone or tablet become outdated before your eyes.** Being stuck with it is even worse. Well, now we’ve got your back. **Protect**CELL **BUYBACK**TM will pay you a worthy amount for your trade-in that will offset your next purchase of the latest “got-to-have” device. And it’s included in your plan for no extra charge. That’s a beautiful thing.

**Getting phone calls or letters regarding credit approvals for accounts you didn’t request?** That can be a sign that you’re a victim of identity theft. Whenever in doubt just give us a call at [[tel:877.775.3274|877.775.3274]]. We’ll put you in touch with a Resolution Specialist who will be dedicated to investigating the situation on your behalf and, if necessary, remediating the damage identity theft can inflict on you. That’s the benefit of having ID Theft Support Powered by LifeLock®. Make sure to activate this feature when logged into [protectcell.com](http://www.protectcell.com/My-Plan.aspx).

**More good news… as a Protect**CELL **customer you also get unrestricted access to our online Rewards Mall**—an exclusive, personalized shopping experience with over 300 merchants, including Target, Kohl's, Home Depot and many others. Earn WOW Rewards Points on purchases, and use them to get more of the things you want! (So many things…) Think of it this way, the money you save can easily pay for your **Protect**CELL plan in no time. Nice. Make sure to activate this feature when logged into [protectcell.com](http://www.protectcell.com/My-Plan.aspx).

Nothing’s more important to us than protecting you. If your device, personal information or identity is ever compromised, we'll be there. Meanwhile, if you have questions, send an email to info@ProtectCELL.com, or call [[tel:877.775.3274|877.775.3274]] to speak with one of our ready, willing and able team members.
