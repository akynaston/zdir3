none I can think of.  If I remember more I'll send them your way.  Metro 2033 and Metro last light had a cool story but the game is SO HORRIFYING.  You are always out of bullets, slinking through dark tunnels while growling monsters chase you.  

Dishonored
Tomb Raider
Sleeping Dogs

Dishonored is an AMAZING stealth game - some of the most enjoyable mechanics I've ever played.  Story is so so.

Tomb Raider AWESOME story and gameplay

Sleeping dogs was one of the best narrative experiences I've ever had and the gameplay has a learning curve but gets super super super fun.

If I had to recommend two it would be bioshock infinite and sleeping dogs :)
