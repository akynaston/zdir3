**AOUR FAVORITE MEATLOAF**

3 pounds ground beef
1 ½ cups rolled oats
½ cup chopped onions
2 teaspoons salt
½ teaspoon pepper
2 eggs, beaten
1 can evaporated milk (1½ cups)

Sauce:
1 cup catsup
6 tablespoons brown sugar (3/8 cup)
3 tablespoons prepared mustard

Heat oven to 350. Combine all ingredients; mix well. Press firmly into a 9" x 13" pan. Combine all sauce ingredients; pour over meat loaf. Bake about 45 minutes.

This recipe used to be on the back of the Buckeye Rolled Oats bag. They quit printing it on there, so I wrote to the Quaker Oats Company and requested the recipe. For Valentines Day, I shape the meat loaf into a heart and bake it on a cookie sheet. Pretty and yummy! My mom likes to mix up a batch and stuff bell peppers (which have been cooked in boiling water for a few minutes) with the mixture. She then freezes them, and just cooks as many as needed at a time for a quick, delicious meal.
