# Kenzie talk

Kenzie talk
I wanted to talk today about heavily father. Wtaj a blessing it is to know how much heavily father loves me. He has given us a plan of happiness that helps us knownwhat to do and how to get back home with him.

I love to be in a family that cares about me and teaches me to love one another just like heavenly father. I say these thignsÂ in the name of Jesus Christ amen.
