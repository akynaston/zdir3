 - Don't remember when I"m supposed to replace the little rectaungular filter, and I've lost the bag, and I tink there was some in there.
      - every two . .weeks - lost the bag . .
      - pack of 2 is 4 dollars.
      - mailing issue: not doing it through insurance.
      - 150 - airfit f20 . . - only one more - 
 - woke up one night this week, and my full mask was on the floor, still conencted to the tubing, but my cpap machine was off, and the block on the plug was really hot.  I just ent back to sleep; int he morning it seemed fine, I assume it just overheated then worke dagain when it was ok; is my cpap machine ok?
\- I've turne doff the tube temp, and I've set the humiidy as high as it goes and I still wake up with a really dry mouth - not a huge deal, but it's enough to make me wonder if I can do something better.
      - temprature - 70 - room is colder . . avoid condesnation
      - try and see if setting humidity at 4 or 5.
      - water in water chamber - doesn't run out . . 8 . .
\- If I have to get up in the middle of the night and get a drink, I assume I just need to disk connect the tubing at the mask, and shut off the cpap so it's not just conastnaly blowing air, or what's the best thing to do here?

\- I was curious, when 1 month rolls around, I don't have a nasal pillow on the f20 mask, so I assume I don't need to replace antying - what about at 3 and 6 months? Do I need to login somehwere and request supplies, or do they come automatically.?
      - order more oon this pone 
      - can get the solcnation - 
      - facemask relacement at a month . . .
\- I'd like to fit my mask better on my face still.  You had mentioned that I cna pull the top strap to make it go up and down, and I think the bottom to hold it closer to my face - I haven't been able to figure this out yet - I did find if I make the bototm really tight it sems to work, but then it holds my jaw open and that doesn't seem right.
      - Any tip sthere?
      - general sicoon mask - puff out a litle
      - then laydown - adjust a little.
\-      - lots ofpopele - too tite . .

8 bucks  - nxt few days.
