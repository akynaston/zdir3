# Re: Club Meeting - July 7th - Minutes

All,

Today's meeting was full of Sagascity.  Please see <http://www.yourdictionary.com/sagacity> if you missed our meeting :-)

We started off with "Merrie's Miracles" for Merrie's ice breaker speech. Merrie began and ended her speech by singing!  Way to start off your speech by providing such excellent variety and enjoyment; it's cool to see ways that our group has changed the experience of what it means to give a speech.  In her speech she spoke of many difficult and trying situations in which she was able to learn and grow.  Serving a mission in Ontario Canada taught her that she can and has done tough things. Through her own home business and even some air time on Venezuelan TV, she's done awesome.  I think everyone would agree with me Merrie, that your speech was great.

Then we had Rodney do one of his "sales" speeches - which of course means that we had some awesome standup comedy! After explaining to us that Sales conferences typically have a comedy time slot, or some other entertainment; he decided to go that direction, and I thought it turned out nicely. I loved learning more about your 13 kids that seemed to illicit silly comments from strangers; and your van to take them around. I loved learning that babies come from Louisiana (I know what to tell my kids now), and that the "I got your nose trick" works only with some severe modifications when your knuckle fails to match your kids noses :-) I forever will see pinewood derby cars differently, and will remember that loosing your house doesn't mean that you misplaced it, but that some one else gets to live there.  I thought it was hilarious learning that you were going to make a living off of the LDS church there whether or not it was through an official paycheck. Thanks for the funny speech.

Susan then did an excellent idea for Table Topics - she placed a set of brown paper bags on the railing, and each of us had to come up and feel the item in the bag and talk about it, then open it and see if we got it right; it was fun to see people go up there and try to find out what they would be talking about in a unique way.

During our evaluations, I thought it was fun to hear about how facial expressions do a lot to tell story - that just the right facial expression at just the right time can add the much needed color to particular points in a speech. Thanks guys - I really enjoy this section.

All in all, a great meeting.  Thanks guys!
