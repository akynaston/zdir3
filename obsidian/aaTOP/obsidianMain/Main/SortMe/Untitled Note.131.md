#ToastMasters - Speech 3

Title: An Audience for an Audience.
Purpose: Get to the point: 

Aaron's speech for project #3 is titled "Own your face!". In his speech today, he will cause you to look inward and reassess how you present yourself to the world. Be prepared to receive great power, in only 5 to 7 minutes  - Aaron Kynaston, "Own your face!"

PREPARATION: Get snickers bar in a wrapper - maybe get a mask? Andrew's optimus prime.

I have something with me today that I deeply treasure. Over the years, it has given me consistent happiness, and has never let me down.

Hold up a snickers bar still in it's wrapper (pause)

Can anyone tell me what this is?  (snickers bar)

( - Same person I asked: )  - HOw did you know that?

 - YES - you read the **face** of the candy bar.  You can see by it's very well known title that it is a snickers.  

**Isn't it beauitful?**

(hold up a finger, then open candy bar throw wrapper on the floor, hold candy bar) - "This I will save for later" (set candy bar on the desk in bag).

Stare at wrapper on the floor & supermanstance & make a face at the audience.

Pick up the wrapper and stare at it.

Before you told me this was a snickers bar, now what is it?

It is now litter! The wrapper has been slightly modified as it's purpose has concluded. It's interesting to me that the face of this candy bar has changed only slightly, yet it is a complete piece of trash now.  While the bueatuiful letters still call to me, their promise of sweet perfection is completely hollow.

As I have given speeches and other public talks lately, I have found a common thread every time I've stood up in front of people. I am just as much of an audience as you are. I am in a unique position to see all of your faces. All of us, like this snickers bar wrapper have something in common. We have a face that is very powefull in expressing who and what we are. and how we are feeling.

Lets do a little test and get some empirical data, but you need to follow my instructions exactly.  

Ready?

Freeze the expression on your face. Close your eyes and see if you can identify what expression you have and why you put it there.

What expression was there? Were you smiling? Were you frowning? Were you sleeping? Were you bored?  Was your face masking how you really felt? Was your face betraying how you really felt? 

Next test: For these next few items, as I give you instructions, look around the room at each other, and whatch how this affects you.

Force yourself to smile. Force yourself to frown.  Force yourself to show an angry face.  Did you notice how not only your own feeligns changed, but those around you were immediately affected too?

As we give speeches, especially in a setting like this one, your facial expression is even more a major part of our learning how to speak in front of people. IN this case, the speaker becomes the audience.  And, as many of us have discussed, there's a thought process int he back of our heads that is automatically and constantly converting facial expressions to reflections of how we are doing as a speaker. I"m not saying it's right or wrong, only that it is happening.

OH - Kim is interested now - or Jesse thought that was funny, or Jill just counted another one of my double clutches.

I submit to you that your facial expression in all of your communication has a massive impact on the speaker.  And especially here! 

(HOld snickers bar wrapper)

With only slight changes to your face, you can completely change what you are presenting. If you choose to own your face, you will find that you immediately will have great power and a new ability to not only help those you communicate with to be more successful, but to even improve your own well being.

(hold up candy bar) 
I know I"m feeling better already!

(take a bite!)
