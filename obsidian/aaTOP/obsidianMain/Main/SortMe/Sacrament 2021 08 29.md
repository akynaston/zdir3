Grace for grace... A piece at a time.

Either getting more, or losing what we have... Not much staying the same.

Paced progress... Neal a Maxwell.

Be open to always receive more.

Loud bold and boastful from adversary

Stop spending time trying to open the wrong keyhole.

Message about not being in alignment from God.

Find the silence man :-)
