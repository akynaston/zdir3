(You will lose all of your app data and apps installed, your internal storage will be fine, backup is recommended anyways
Download **[G900VVRU2BOK3_G900VVZW2BOK3_VZW.zip](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=24349802275799044)** and unzip it
Reboot to recovery (Power+Volume Up+Home Button) and wipe data from recovery, reboot to bootloader
Plug In your phone and open Odin located in the Root\_OG5\_V(#) folder
Make sure your phone is recognized (In the Odin Screen Under ID:COM the box under will be blue with your com port id #)
Click the AP button in the Odin Screen and locate and click on the G900VVRU2BOK3\_G900VVZW2BOK3\_G900VVRU2BOK3\_HOME.tar .md5 this is the file that was unziped from the G900VVRU2BOK3\_G900VVZW2BOK3\_VZW.zip(Everything you do will be flashed via AP!!!!)
This will take a few minutes for odin to load and verify MD5. When done in the odin message box it will say
**

Code:
 Enter CS for MD5..
 Check MD5.. Do not unplug the cable..
 Please wait..
 G900VVRU2BOK3\_G900VVZW2BOK3\_G900VVRU2BOK3\_HOME.tar.md5 is valid.
 Checking MD5 finished Sucessfully..
 Leave CS.

**
Under options DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING (Previously I had you check NandErase but this was part of the problem with root not finishing)
Now click on Start
When finished you will get a green box that says PASS!
Phone will reboot automatically to recovery and finish updating then it will restart
When Phone has finished loading and has booted up go through setup and do not add any google accounts or samsung accounts or anything
3\. Plug your phone into computer. Locate the folder **Apps\_To\_Install** and place it on your phone do not install any of them yet!
4\. Go to Settings/Display and set your screen timeout to 5 min (You don't need to do this I only say this so you don't miss the Allow USB Debugging Screen and the Update Super Su Binary screen latter in the procedure)
5\. Go to settings on phone and find about phone and click on build number 5 times to enable developer options
6 Now goto the Root\_OG5\_V(#) folder you extracted on your computer and open the **G900V\_TEAM\_ROOT folder**
7\. Click on the **ROOT\_G900V\_5.0.bat** and Plug your phone into the computer
8\. On your phone go to Settings/Developer Options and enable USB Debugging
9\. Allow USB Debugging dialog comes up check always allow this computer and click ok. If it doesn't come up in Settings/Developer Options and under USB Debugging click Revoke USB debugging authoriztions. This should bring up the dialog Allow USB Debugging dialog comes up check always allow this computer and click ok
**Now Pay Attention!!!**
10\. From the the ROOT\_G900V\_5.0.bat type option 5 Connect to Phone Make sure at the top under List of devices attached you see for example

Code:
                           **BELOW IS YOUR DEVICE STATUS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List of devices attached
0abb967d        device
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

11\. Now choose option 1 to Reboot To Stock Recovery
12\. In stock recovery Wipe Cache only! Do Not wipe Data! After you wipe Cache you will have to pull the battery (The Reboot to Bootloader from Stock Recovery will not work after you wipe cache) Reboot to Bootloader (Power+Volume Down+Home Button)
13\. Use **Odin\_3.10.0** located in the **Root\_OG5\_V(#) Folder** and install **01\_G900V\_NI2\_Kernel.tar**. Your phone will reboot and get stuck on the Samsung screen, this is ok!
14\. Plug in your phone(if not already) open the ROOT\_G900V\_5.0.bat and make sure you have this

Code:
                           **BELOW IS YOUR DEVICE STATUS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List of devices attached
0abb967d        device
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

If above is blank select option 5 Connect To Phone(if you continue to have issues, see the extra notes)
15\. Now select option 2 Start Root
16\. If the root process hangs for more than 2 minutes (Example Below) Unplug Phone Pull Battery Reboot to recovery wipe cache only, then start at step 12. Make sure phone is connected.

Code:
**\[-\] WAITING FOR YOUR DEVICE G900V
\[\*\] If The Process Hangs For More Than 2 Minutes\[\*\] Unplug Phone Pull Battery Reboot To Recovery (Pwr+VolUp+Home) Wipe Cache Only\[\*\] Choose 3 To Start Again\[\*\]\[\*\] ROOT INSTALLING NOW .......................................................................

---------------------------------------------------------------
If You Do Not See The Message ======= KRSLOG ROOT DONE =======
---------------------------------------------------------------
This Probably Means Your Not Rooted**

If root is successful you will see this

Code:
\[-\] WAITING FOR YOUR DEVICE G900V

**\[\*\] If The Process Hangs For More Than 2 Minutes\[\*\] Unplug Phone Pull Battery Reboot To Recovery (Pwr+VolUp+Home) Wipe Cache Only\[\*\] Choose 3 To Start Again\[\*\]\[\*\] ROOT INSTALLING NOW .......................................................................
KRSLOG: ROOT DONE!

---------------------------------------------------------------
If You  See The Message ======= KRSLOG ROOT DONE =======
---------------------------------------------------------------
This Probably Means Your Your Rooted!**

17\. When finished pull your battery on your phone. Replace battery and reboot to download mode Power+Volume Down+Home
18\. Use odin and Flash the BOK3 Kernel found in the **Odin\_Lollipop\_Kernels**
19. **When phone reboots **Install All Apps in the Apps\_To\_Install folder** you placed on your phone**
20\. Open **KingRoot.apk** Click The Up Arrows a couple of time until you get to Try It and click Try It and that's it don click nothing else just close Kingroot. You should now have root. If It says Root not available and the bat said your were rooted Reboot Phone and open KingRoot You should now be rooted(otherwise return to step 12, make sure to wipe cache first)
21\. Now open **SuperSU-Me app (This app is now a paid app so setup Google Play and buy** and it will remove kinguser and replace it with SuperSu. If you can't get the Paid version to work. The SuperSu Me 6.7 version worked. So you may have to hunt that one down)
22\. After this process SuperSu will ask to update binary click update normal
23\. Copy this Folders to your SD Card and Internal Storage **Safestrap\_Flashable\_Kernels and Safestrap\_Flashable\_Firmware** and anything else you want to install like the below rom
24\. Now open **Busybox Installer It will show BusyBox is already installed Reinstall Busybox even though it says its installed** . Click on **Lollipop Safstrap** and click **Install Safestrap** after it installs click the back button and click on **Recovery Reboot**
25\. I would flash a custom rom as soon as you get busybox and safestrap installed
[VZW_BOK3_STOCK_ROM_DEODEXED.zip](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=24345424848488430)
26\. Remember when using Safestrap to return to rom from Safestrap recovery you must flash the **Safestrap Flashable kernel zip** matching your firmware The BOK3 is the one you want
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extra Information
If you soft brick your device and you made a backup in safe strap, flashing the NI2 kernel will get you back into safestrap, allowing you to restore your backup
THIS DOES NOT UNLOCK YOUR BOOT LOADER!!! There is currently no way to unlock the bootloader. You cannot flash anything through the stock recovery. Do not try to, you will softbrick!
If you try and flash a rom or anything else, make a backup first, it saves many headaches.
If you cannot flash roms with the error "set\_metadata\_recursive failed" or something, you likely need to start from scratch BUT with the S5 PIT file(matching your size, there's a 16GB pitfile floating somewhere)
Realize your phone warranty is likely gone after doing this, should anything arise, you can try and get to download mode and flash the stock image again and it may go back to normal status but we cannot encourage fraudulent warranties, no matter how pathetic Samsung's policies are
If you get stuck with device offline after flashing NI2, or similar, a process that works sometimes is to unplug the phone and pull the battery, in the TEAM\_ROOT\_G900V script select 2 and it will say "waiting for phone", put the battery back in the phone and hold power, once it vibrates plug it in immediately. you will here a beep and it should root. If you still cannot after a few tries get it to work, post for help!
While you have the NI2 kernel flashed, be aware, if you pull the battery to try again, you have to unplug your phone as well. If you connect the battery while on a charger or PC with the NI2 kernel flashed, the charging screen will be stuck on your phone and you cannot get out of it without pulling the battery again. This is just because the NI2 kernel doesn't place nice with new stuff

No disrespect intended but I am not going to flash up to stock locked from where I am to test it !! Come on people !!! If you have a locked phone and want root, here's your chance to contribute to a potential major break through on our phones ...

Edit: Confirmed Working!!
Notice I didn't either, but it should work since all you have to do is flash the NI2 kernel which you can still do on the oe1.og5 and ok3 firmwares. They just wouldn't let you flash the ncg system.img

Yes it works. However my unknown mistake after achieving root with my bok phone was that I immediately installed titanium backup and a message came up saying something about an unauthorized action. My phone rebooted and now says start up failed . Use the verizon softwair repair assistant on a computer to repair your device. Of course this is impossible. I suppose if I had installed busybox and safestap first and placed a rom on the phone I would have been ok. Fortunately the phone was a spare but I'm still not happy.

Flash the [BOK3 kernel](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=24349802275799045) it should boot
If it doesnt, Here is the Odin Factory tar image just flash in odin [G900VVRU2BOK3_G900VVZW2BOK3_VZW.zip](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=24349802275799044). This does not have the BOD5 bootloaders so it will flash fine for you

Thank you JK. How you stay up with all of these threads impresses me. Flashing the bok3 kernel worked. Now to continue I should install the bb and ss because apparently using the phone just rooted with rooted apps won't work?
Also, in the process of rooting as advice to anyone who wants to do it; when using the bat program, I found if it doesn't work right away close it then reopen it and it starts right away.
With titanium backup still installed the unauthorized app messge remained so I uninstalled tb and rebooted the phone with no problem
