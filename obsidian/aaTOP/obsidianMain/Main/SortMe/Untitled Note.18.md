Aaron's Server intro thoughts
Hey man! would you be ok with Easton joining a Terraria server that I run? If he has a phone or kindle with the game Terraria loaded that's compatible with 1.4.0.5.2, he can join!  If you are ok with it, we'll be on throughout the day at: 162.219.42.134:7777

I've started hosting a Mobile Device Server for Terraria and Minecraft. The current IP and port are:

162.219.42.134:7777

The rules are as follows:
 - I am the server admin: Aaron Kynaston, at akynaston@gmail.com, cell: 801 368 8633.  Please text me if you have questions.
 - The servers are running on a dynamic IP address, so may be subject to change at any time. I will try to find a way to keep you updated.
 - The server is not guaranteed to be up 24/7. In fact, when I'm working during the day, it will not be available.  Please email/text me if you have questions; I'll respond when I can.
 - If you are caught breaking these rules, you may be temporarially or permantently banned.
 - No Grifting, though see rules below! For Noobs (new players) this means that you shouldn't join the map just to ruin or steal things.
 - If you have items you want to donate to the world, please add it to an existing chest, or drop a new one, and leave them there. The hope is that everyone will add to, and benefit from the shared world.
 - Every item left in the map is meant to help everyone. If you find something and can use it, please take it.
 - Please work to add to the map by placing ores, items, and other things that others can use.

Current goals:
 - We would like to get a bunch of people and defeat the Wall of Flesh.  he's the main boss at the bottom of the map that chages your world into hardmode. This requires a few steps:
     - We should have a bunch of people join, and add get outfitted with a bunch of good armor, and guns.
     - We should get a bunch of potions for everyone.
 - Once hardmode is reached, we need to defeat the three mechanical bosses - they are very difficult to beat.
