Dear Birth Parents,

Thank you for your desire to look into adoption for your child. It is an overwhelming experience for us to try to find the right words to write to you. We hope that you can feel of our love and the love that your Heavenly Father has for you. We cannot imagine the difficult things that you are going through at this time. Please know that our hearts and prayers go out to you. We pray that you will feel the comfort of the Spirit as you work through this process.

Jenny’s siblings have had the pleasure of adding five children to our extended family through adoption already. They have adopted one child from Utah, two from China, and two from Vietnam. Each child is very important and has added so much love to our whole family. We are thrilled to start our own family through adoption as well. We are happy that you are taking a moment to browse our profile. Hopefully this will give you a chance to learn more about us. We are grateful to you for the loving decision you are making.

Jenny and I had the lucky opportunity of meeting each other in a student ward in Logan, Utah. I walked into church and noticed a beautiful, curly haired girl in the row in front of me. I just had to meet her. I don't believe in love at first sight, but I hoped maybe she did. I timidly tapped her shoulder and said, "Hi, I'm Carl!" I didn't have her captivated instantly, but being in the same ward and living in the same apartment complex provided me with many opportunities to win her heart. Little did I know, she was out to win mine as well. I won her heart within the month, and we were married eight months later. We have been married for over 4 years and recently bought our first home. We are so deeply in love with one another and cannot wait to share our love with a little one.

Carl grew up in Utah County. He went on a mission to Neuquen, Argentina where he learned a love for the people and language. He graduated in Computer Science from Utah State University. Carl has a contagious smile. It was the first thing I noticed about him, and it is still the very first thing that everyone mentions when they describe him. Carl loves to be funny! Whether he is telling jokes, making silly faces, or coming up with funny one-liners; Carl enjoys making others laugh. He loves to be able to find new, cool gadgets to play with. He is an avid harmonica player. He even has a harmonica holder so he can try to play guitar and harmonica at the same time. Spending time with family is very important to Carl. Besides talking, singing, playing card games, and eating together; one of the many things he loves to do with family is play video games. There are not words to explain Carl’s love for children. Whenever we are with any group of people (family, friends, and strangers), children flock to Carl; and he loves to spend his time playing with all of them.

Jenny grew up in Salt Lake County. She received an Associates Degree from Salt Lake Community College and then moved on to Utah State University to get her Bachelors Degree in Elementary Education. Jenny always has enjoyed learning. One of the things that she loves is to get great deals when shopping. Whether it is a new cute shirt or some groceries, she really enjoys saving money. Jenny has a huge love for telling funny stories; although she usually laughs through the punch line. Once she was telling a funny joke to a group of friends, and when she got to the punch line, she was laughing so hard that nobody even knew what she was saying. After she was done talking everyone was silent, but she just kept laughing. Jenny loves to play the piano and read. She is a delight to talk to and a wonderful companion. Having graduated in Elementary Education, she loves very much to teach children. She is super excited to teach her own children.

We love being together. Whether it is dancing, bike riding, playing video games, swimming, going on picnics, or traveling; we just have a blast together. Jenny has had a few Spanish classes, and since Carl learned Spanish on his mission, we are able to work on our Spanish together. Another thing that we love to do together is to spend time with our extended families. It is so fun to be able to talk, laugh, and play with our families.

Thank you very much for taking the time to learn a little bit about our family. We wish you the best as you make your decision. Please know that our hearts and prayers are with you. We know that the Lord will bless you for your loving sacrifice.

Sincerely,

Carl and Jenny
