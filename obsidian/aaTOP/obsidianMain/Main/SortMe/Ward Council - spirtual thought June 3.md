# Ward Council - spirtual thought June 3

The other day I made a comment to the stake president that "personal struggle is expected", since the idea of struggle had been rolling around in my head. I realized without the context that was going on in my head; this sounded like a really simplistic and obvious statement.  Now I feel like I could have said, Guess what, president! <slow>I dress myself. so I felt a bit goofy. I decided to flesh out this thought a bit further.

From the Ensign in October 2001, a talk named "Strength during struggles" by Elder LIonel Kendrick of the 70 says this:

**Life is not always easy to live, but the opportunity to do so is a blessing beyond comprehension. In the process of living we will face struggles, many of which will cause us to suffer and to experience pain. Many people will suffer in personal struggles, while others** **will suffer as they watch their loved ones in pain.**

I am probably not unique in having a severe dislike of pain and struggle in general. There is an infinite range of pain and struggles in our world today, and horrible ugliness that human beings can have towards each other. It's led me to think a lot about the question we ask our selves some times, "Why me? Why do I have to go through this?". I finally found a satisfactory answer.

God went to a lot of trouble to make sure we had a very specific reality that happens to involve very real choice and free will. He sent his son to experience the complete range of the human experience; which is of course is quite soul crushing. This was a great deal of pain, frustration and quite a bit of effort to set up.  

**Personal struggle is expected because it was created intentionally to help us grow.**

This then led me to think instead of saying "why me, why do I have to go through this", we should be ecstatically happy and say instead, "Thank you for choosing me to experience a fraction of a fraction of what the savior went through"; which I think is part of the binding process involved in the atonement, or this 'at one ment' that President Nelson spoke of all the way back in 1996. Isn't this cool  . . .that we get to share something in common with the savior? 

While I'm not yet grateful for my struggles, I am thoroughly greatful to have such a potentially deep connectoin to the savior, and a brand new perspective on the atonement. 

I say this .  .
