Glen: training change at TriVir

Team,

We're modifying how we track our training time. The TriVir Internal project contains a Training task that was previously used for most, if not all training time. In order to be a little more specific and to see where our _**non-project specific**_ training time is spent we will now have a new Training 2017 project in OA.

**Phases**

* The project contains the following phases:
	* Mentoring
	* ForgeRock
	* Micro Focus
	* VMware
	* MISC
	* TriVir
* Some of these phases have specific product names listed as phases under the vendor. For example, under Micro Focus we have:
	* Micro Focus Identity Manager
	* Micro Focus Access Manager
	* Micro Focus Identity Governance
	* Micro Focus Privileged Access Management
	* Micro Focus Sales Training

**Tasks**

* The tasks in this Training 2017 project are specific to each person. Under each phase you will want to use YOUR task. Note that not all tasks for every person under every product or phase have been created yet. You'll need to create a task the first time you spend time training on a particular product. 
	
* The task names should be created like this:
	* Product vendor (when applicable) abbreviation (e.g., FR or MF)
	* Product name (e.g., IDM or Identity Governance or IdMUnit)
	* Employee initials (e.g., AP for Alex Pyper, CP for Colton Parry)
	* Following the standard set by existing task names when you're creating one for you (only when you need the task because you spent the time training on that product or topic)
	* The task name for MISC is slightly different--just MISC and the employee initials. The MISC phase should be used for generic topics where you are not spending a lot of time. Ask your manager for guidance in using this task.
		
* Examples
	* Mentoring - TB
	* MF - Identity Governance - ML
	* FR - IDM - JE
	* MF - PAM - WS
	* MISC - AP

**Time Type**

* The project is a TriVir client project which means that the time entries here are always left at the default value of **Billable**(we're not billing ourselves, but it makes reporting easier)

**Utilization**

* Time in the Mentoring phase is **Utilized**. Time in all other phases is **Non-utilized**. Check with your manager if you have questions about time utilization.

When you are spending training time on a **_specific project_** where the training is specific to that project or client it will be appropriate to record your time on that client project in the phase that represents what you are doing and the time type can be changed to Training. This is a new Time Type (like Billable, Non-billable and Non-invoice) that can be selected when you are entering your notes for the time spent. If you are training on IDM in general, that time would go in Training 2017. If you are training on a specific IDM feature or issue connected to project you are working on, that time would go on the project, in the proper task and be marked as Training in the Time Type. If you have questions about whether to record your time in Training 2017 or in a specific client project, please check with you project manager and/or manager.

Thanks,
Glen Knutti
