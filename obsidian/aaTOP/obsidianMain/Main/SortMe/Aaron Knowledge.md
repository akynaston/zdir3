Truth: 
I believe that truth is universal; that part of what makes God God, is the he is so close to the truth, as to have Truth and God be inseparable  hence the saying God is truth. the choices that he makes are so line with truth.

Past that though, it becomes difficult to talk about truth because it typically requires some context, and then has to be perceived. I hate to use the overly used comparison, but I think it is a good one: I personally believe if a tree falls in forest but no one is there to witness it, does it make sound?  Per my own opninion and <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest>, The capacity for sound is there; but unfortunately the definition of sound is the capacity for sound, and the receiving of it; so the actual answer is no; there is no sound, because there was no perceptipn, but that doesn't mean the capacity to make noise wasn't there.

Truth exists despite my acceptance or my personal level of grasp of it.   I recently heard of Jordan Peterson and have really enjoyed his ability to articulate well thought out reasoned thoughts.  For this reason, I wanted to write down exactly what I believe about core ideas; so I can articulate it on demand; and fully decide what I believe!

Source of truth:
    I personally believe that no place, organizatoin or person (including God) has a unique ownership of truth; and that it exists in a number of places; and has to be found. For some this is each religion (I'm personally relatively religious I would say), others this is some public person, or some written set of works, such a the scriptures. 
    A story was shared about people going in to a completely dark room and were asked to hold on to different things, and report on what they thought they had a hold of.  One said a rope, one a spear, one a leather covered wall.  It turns out they 

    How do we verify sources of truth?

Why am I religious?
    Some would say that being religious and rational at the same time isn't possible; and I certainly understand

Belief in God:

Religions truth is not scientific truth.
     - Scriptures are not scientific truth, relision trugh.
Science tells you what things are.
Religion tells you how you should act.

Josn piege: you should aked so that things are good for you; but have to be good for you for your family, and you, famliy, slcieity, AND you, family sciety - then you family scotiety AND harmonios balancing over time. Our Brains reveals that something is meaningful: our systems operate on the order between complexity and chaos.
We're always partily stable and partily curous.: growing and learning; when you have ain intimation of meaning you are there.
These levels of existsance are in patterns: Music so meaning ful because of htis: so many patterns that all mesh properly. Music is modeling a maner of harmonios being. Religions writings are guidlelines to this modes of being; they are 'hyper tru' or 'meta true'.

Take the most true things about all of our lives into a single figure: literaty hero: take a 1000 literary heros: this is a religious diety: Christ is a meta hero.

archetypal mode of being is true speech.

Look at this conversation (he says): he talks and listen, they both talk: together we're building something even more; they are articulatting each other's spiriits.

This is a meaning ful conversation: even talks about feeling the spirit: fals presupositions are diing: something new is being born. This is the process of eternal death and rebirth..

Scriptures are not scientific theories: they're not scientists. 

Value of experience: I firmly believe that despite your religion or even your beliefs that this earth is a place for experience. There's  caution to be said there though: some times this experience should be learned from others.  While suicide may seem interesting to some one; it's difficult to gain any good in your life due to the practice; since the act ends your life by nature. I personally don't drink alchohol; and to some this may seem extreme: In fact, even to myself I consider it extreme: the world alcohol is actually very rich in artistry, diversity, a is huge part of culture; yet no matter how you look at it, there's an undesirable elemnt for modifying my ability to act and make choices in this world: so really, more generally, ANYTHING that affects your abilty to make choices is something that has to seriously be consdiered for its value.  This is also part of why sin is undesirable: it reduces your ability to choose.  Unfortunately words are just sign posts to ideas; and the word sin is too overloaded. I might seem paradoxical here, talking about the value of experience, then turning around and saying there are things that should be experienced through some one lese; but that's exactly my point: experience can be deeply valuable by everyone, despite who is actually doing the experience.

Why is Sin undesirable? First and foemost, I have to say I hate using the word sin, becuase it has so much baggage with it; and too many people see it in too many ways. WORKING HERE 1/31/2018 2:40:55 PM

Jordan Peterson acts if god exists
Jordan peterson: Divnity of Christ?
    What do you mean devine and christ?

 Entitlement:
    - Interesting that socieity pushed to be so entitled: "I deserve this" emails come from all kinds of companies that want me to spend money; or do things that are likely to end up with them making money. Even if I actually do deserve something they're providing, the high number of these kinds of communicators could push any one into a blissful mindless entitlement loops. I'm already making sufficiently poor choices without the pschyogloical battle. I understand their goal is to make money; but I'd almost rather have an email say something like: Be some one that deserves our amazing stuff. Be Understanding, loving and downright amazing to everyone you meet; then come buy our cool new Samsung Galaxy S9 phone; don't polute my head with so much entitlement that can I can't even make a reasonable judgement of my character.
     - Please understand I think I have a reasonably healthy view of myself, but I never want to get to a point where my feelings of entitlement are what I use to make decisions.

Value of time management: if all we did was to stop making thigns wors; we'd all be better!

Abortion:

Sheep to the slaughter: Just had an interesting mentality: every time I feel like I"M just following the crowd in something; it makes me really rethink if "M dong the right thing.

Reality:
    What is reality  but a set of perceptions? Perceptions are a series of inputs from the standard 5 senses - if I chose to ignore one input, and maximimze another (aka close my eyes and max my earphones on a song); I am changing my realilty. While some laws seem pervasive and unchangable (gravity, time, lack or prescence of light), I still have the ability to percieve or not percieve various elements; thereby changing my relaity.

What scares me the most? 2/8/2018 11:15:58 AM
    To see the ugliness in the world, and see those same seeds of dishonesty, selifishness and soul eating pride reflected in my own self.
Second: to feel out of control. In reality; none of us are probably ever really in contro; but some of us are more flexible than others. This is why I love Lee Child's Jack Reacher character: he is extreemly practical;,a nd takes care of situations in whatever ways he can.
