# cHICKEN - enemey training.

"What do you truely own Laithian?" Laithin thought for a moment, his mind briefly passing over obvious things, like his home, his clothing, his family.  Laithin decided to be cautious, and respond with something he thought might be clever.
"My thoughts?" Laithin asked carefully. Teven smiled, then said,
"That's a good place to start, but I was thinking something slightly different. You're ability to choose is truely the olything you own"
"Lathin< who is your enemy?"
Laihtin thought about it for a omment.  Teven always seemed to teach by asking open ended questions, but was always expecting something specific. The immediate first though of course, was the creater that took his father. A wall of pain hit him, and Laithin had to swallow to put the tought behind him. Laithain couldn't think of anything clever to say, so he picked the obvious.
"Is it evil?" Laithan said weakly.
"Its a good start, but what is evil? What exactl.y is evil?" Laithin was worried he would have to elaborate,l but Teven continued.
"The enemy is the dam of ignorance, the knife of indifference, and the heartlessness of ingrattitude. Since our will is our only true thing we own, the tirck is learning to make choices to lead us to the consequesitons to gather intelligence, be aware of all that is around you, and be thinakful for it.
