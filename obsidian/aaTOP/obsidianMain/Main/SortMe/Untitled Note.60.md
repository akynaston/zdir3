# Untitled Note

Hints when using linked tables in AC:
     - make a very clear delineation between data gathering locations, and final AC locations.
     - Consider implications of maintaining linked tables vs unlinking them; then working on the manually.

         - Data gathering: can change as much as needed; and should.
         - AC locations can not change as easily since docs don't auto update formulas.
         - Use "=filter" to restrict to a subset of data
