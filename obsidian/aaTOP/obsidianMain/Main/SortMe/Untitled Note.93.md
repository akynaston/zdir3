Talk on the deep roots of personal change.

Brothers and sisers.  I am going to have to stop praying for answers because I keep getting them. I have found that my disposition tends to be one of great stubbornness, but I've started to see a pattern in the way the spirit talks to me personally.. This pattern seems to follow the following points:

1 - Incessant repitition.
2 - Extreemly simple, easy to understand messages.
3 - A sense of overwhelming love of God for people
4 - A sense of overwhelming love from God.

Let me talk more about these items.

1 - Incessant repittion.  
I am a simple guy. This not a self deprecating statement, it is simple reality. I would like to think that this the good kind of simplicity; maybe it will be some day. God has seen fit to not only accept me as am I, but to whittle at my stubborn simple brain, until I finally under stand something.

When I was younger, my dad pointed at a Chinese elm tree that had grown 20 feet or so, that was shading our garden. He told me that he would pay me some money if I could cut the tree down, he'd pay me 10 bucks.  I was sold. 10 bucks was a lot of money to me back then, and still is. I spent that summer digging the snot out of that tree. I worked on it for hours. My plan was to cut off all the low branches, then simply dig a hole around the tree until I could get to the roots and pull it out. I hadn't realized that I had both underestimated the task, and overestimated my ability. My dad, probably after seeing my consternation, took me aside, and taught me how tree roots are pretty intense.  He taught me that they typcialy grow very deep, easily the same distance as the height of the tree, spreading in all directions. It ddidn't occur to be mad at him at the time becaues I was fascinated to learn something new, but then realized I probably wasn't going to get paid any money becuase I was asked to do an impossible job.

The next day, I realized that the task to get rid of that tree was no longer a matter of money. It was now, completely a matter of pride. Packing a saw, shouvle, and my moms best kitchen knife, I walked back to that tree, and dug, cut and saw at the thing until every branch on that tree lay in a pile next to me. Keep in mind, that I had dug quite an impressive moat around this tree. You can imagine me trying to get at the branches, while up to my knees in a hole that, by the way I ahd dug myself, was not helping me progress on the task, but I kept at it. My pride woudln't let me do anything different.

Afterwards, you should have seen that beautiful stump. If you have ever seen a corn dog after a two year old has had it for 15 minutes, you know what I"m talking about. After a time, I sat on the ground, and thought to myself, that my dad really should have offered me more money for this kind of task. 

In tears, I went back to my Dad, and let him inspect my work.  I was happy to find out, that He had decided to pay me, because a stump doesn't throw much shade, so the orignal task was completed. My mind works just like this tree: a physical embodiment of deep stubbornness. only through reptition, sawing with that saw, digging with that shovel, and yes, stabbing with my mother's best kitchen knife this tree was changed into something that was more agreeable to our desire for a healthy garden.

After giving several gentle nudges, I feel like God says, Kynaston, It's time to change. yes, he refers to me by last name when I don't listen very well. I constantly pushed towards the will of God like a tree stump that wouldn't give way.

2 - Extreemly simple, easy to understand messages.
I am greatulf for the fact that God knows me so well. one of the ways to idenfity promptings of the spirit from our own mind, is the level of clarity and surety with which they enter your mind. when God talks to us, its powerful. Its humbling. the most accurate way I can put it, is that "It's the best kind of overwhelming there is". One of my favorite treats are pieces of random types of cheese. Revelation from God is like finding and eating that last piece of peper jack cheese. Delicious, satisfying, and just a little bit spicy.

3 - A sense of overwhelming love of God for people

I had a chance to speak with a good friend of mine that I work with, who is also the bishop of his ward.  Recently, I've seen how much time biships and other leaders in our church spend in meetings and are away from their families. I felt inspired to ask him if he enjoys the calling. I went to him and said, "Can I ask you a quick personal question?" Ye said yes, and so I said bluntly, do you enjoy being a bishop? I shoudln't have implied that the conversation was going to be quick. after about 20 minutes of him explaining why being a bishop was one of the most incredible tasks of his life, I could finally see how he was sustained in the hefty task. His deep love of the the members in his ward. I could tell from his eyes and voice as he spoke that he cared deeply for them: that he wanted them to be happy, and balance personal talent with the challenges that the callings would bring up.

After the discussion, I could see through this man, the love that God has for us: I could see the people receiving callings in his mind were of great worth and value to God and was greatulf fo rthe conersation. 

The reality of God, his son, and their love for us is real. I think i had gotten into subconcious habit these things were just pretty things to say, and not meant to be real; but after seconds of experiencing this feeling, I feel inspired all over again to be amazing in responsabilities like home teaching, and and my calling as a primary teacher.

4 - A sense of overwhelming love from God.
