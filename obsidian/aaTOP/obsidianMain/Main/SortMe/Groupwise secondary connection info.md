# Groupwise secondary connection info

Monique,
    The secondary webmail address is [http://webmail3.memphisemail.com](http://webmail3.memphisemail.com/).
The secondary client connection can be accessed by changing the GroupWise client under Accounts->Account Options and double clicking on the GroupWise account -> Advanced tab and changing the IP Address to email2.memphisemail.com leaving the port the same. Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Jimmy
