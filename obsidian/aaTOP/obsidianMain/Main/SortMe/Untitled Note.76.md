401 K loan info 8/24/2017 11:25:34 AM

All,

There was a question on 401(k) loans on the all-TriVir call last Friday and I found out some more information.  

You can submit a loan request to American Funds up until the the blackout date for the transition to the new plan, which is currently scheduled for the first week in October (notice will be sent next week with final details). I would not wait until the last minute to submit, it takes a couple of days to process.  After the blackout period ends (~end of October) you can submit to Lincoln.  American Funds uses an online request process from your account on their website (<https://americanfunds.retirementpartner.com/login.do>), I assume the process Lincoln is somewhat the same.

Here are the specifics:

> **American Funds**
> $85 Loan Origination fee
> $50 Annual Maintenance
> Interest Rate:  Prime 
> 
> **Lincoln**
> $60 Loan Origination Fee
> $30 Annual Maintenance
> Interest Rate: Prime

Let me know if you have any questions.   I will be out the rest of this week, so I might be a bit delayed on a response.

Thanks,
Julie
