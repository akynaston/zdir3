# TM - NOtes

Be AWESOME.. ACCEPT THE fact that we are human  and stop making excuses
tessee thoughts:
     - Saw your perplexed speech - very nice.
        Asbolutely loved the Starwars one - when I saw you pull that out, I just about bought one on Amazon; so cool.
         - do you mind some feedback? 
         - For a child to see a new toy that fascinates them is a huge magical moment - I wanted to hear more about this magical moment you were having - what exactly fascniated you? was it the fact that it was a spherical maze? that the ball was trapped inside, and could follow the maze? what exactly was magical about it?
             - Animator 2000 story
         - Also wanted more real stories when you actualy got to open the present - or when you learned the sound of shaking the present - you covered it and that was great but, I wanted to be part of the actual discovery of that sound - the moment when your soul translated that sound to complete joy.
         - You have excellent prescens and a very high amount of confidence in your speaking (Are you nervious at all? I whish i could have seen your first speeches)- I would like to see even more of that:
             - Use more almost over the top facial expressions - you have a great story telling face
             - Slightly more eggatuated volume (on the extreems: louder louds & softer softs)
             - increase the obviousness of your actions - gives so much color; you seem like your such a natural at this, I'd like tos e more.
         - Next thought half formed . . .ever since Rodney's poetry readng, I realized how much fun and power it gives to a speech with what you are dressed in - I think for your speech, if you were obviously dressed like a little kid (not sure how to do this); it would have added more.

     - interesting/good news: My fear is changing now: its now bsed in entirely how prepared I am. I used to think that having the content would make me less scared, but it's missing both the content and delivery practice that causes fear for me now - I have much less fear when both are competely prepared - in fact, if I feel like I have something that is clever or funny, or filled with meaning, and I've practice the delivery enough times, I feel exicted instead of scared.
     - Practicing the delivery was key to remembering what I was oging to say, and lessening the ahs' and ums.
     - Seeing myself in video made me realize lots of things - I really love when a speaker seems like they're having so much fun - YO uhever seen Tom thum perform his beat boxing? YOucan tell he absolutely loves it.
     - Ideas for next speech
         - (finding a good definition for the word reality, and components of it).
         - Cheese. props
         - The art of Karma in relationships, Getting people on your side.
             - Element of skevieness
         - The Awesomness of Silly Putty
         - The Magic of Magnets.
         - Animator 2000
         - Ingrown nose hairs
             - Bordres on being too gross - more gross than funny perhaps.
