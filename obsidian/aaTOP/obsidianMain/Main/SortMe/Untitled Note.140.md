Mothers day talk

It is an honor to be able to speak about Mothers on mothers day. I'm greatful to be able to speak about a position in the family that is so important.  Being a mother is quite often a tough, often thankless kind of position in the family that lacks a paycheck and any benefits, except for those that the Mother can derive from her experience and closeness to her kids.

I don't think we can get through a mothers day without mentioning Alma 56:47, when taling about the source of strenght of Helaman's 2000 stirpilng warirros:

IN Alma 56:47 it says:
 **Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.**

Watching my mom as I grew up made me realize I was  lucky to end up with some one so incredibly gifted with qualities found in only few people, and shown perfectly in the savior. I'm greatful that I can categorize my own mother among the mothers of these warriors.  It gives me a an overwhelming example to live up to when seeing what these 2000 sons were able to do with their testimonies.

This really makes me think. What kind of human beings could cause these Helaman's sons to have such a strong faith that they could go fight a battle when their own experience in actual fighting was severely lacking? They knew they were risking their lives, and a huge part of their strength was because their mothers had taught them about their reliance on god.

I found a poem called Super Mom that seemed applicable to the moms I know in my life:

(http://www.poemsource.com/mother-poems.html)

Mom, you're a wonderful mother,
So gentle, yet so strong.
The many ways you show you care
Always make me feel I belong.

You're patient when I'm foolish;
You give guidance when I ask;
It seems you can do most anything;
You're the master of every task.

You're a dependable source of comfort;
You're my cushion when I fall.
You help in times of trouble;
You support me whenever I call.

I love you more than you know;
You have my total respect.
If I had my choice of mothers,
You'd be the one I'd select!

I thought that quite clearly expresses my thoughts.

My mom is awesome. I remember so many times where she simply made everything better even int he middle of a catastrophe.
Once when I fell, and face planted on a sharp concrete edge and cut my lip really bad, without giving the details, I was grateful that my mom made everything all better even when the feeling that my mouth was going to fall off. I remember playing a defensivie position in a soccer game and at oine point I was too cllose to the golie.  He jumped out to save the ball, and ended up breaking my leg. My mom again rescued me from panic and fear. I love how she has given me so much.

You can imagine that when I started considering getting married, My future wife had a lot to live up to.

I knew very clearly that I wanted my future wife to be someone that had this incredible deep love, infinite patience. Some one that is able to make dinner while simultaneously helping the kids with their home work, and hopefully still have a spare hand to give me a foot massage while she finishes the dishes.

And then I met this pretty girl named Leah Cunningham. Aside from the fact that she was competely beautiful, I was amazed to see how deeply she loved and cared about people.  If you know Leah (and I would be surprised if there are any in our ward that doesn't know her yet), you know that she loves people, to talk and share everything with everyone.  I quickly came to see that she would bend over backwards and sweat for hours on something before even thinking about saying no to some one.

The single most incredible, and beautiful thing I've seen in my entire life, was to see my wife hold her each of our 4 children for the very first time. Despite the tough times that come with raising a family, it has been amazing to see her care for our kids. There's been so many times where I've been completely frustrated with kids making crazy choices.  My wife seems to have a frustration detector because she always steps in and redirects me to change a bad situation into one where I can actually improve as a father, and this is really cool. She has a strong sense of what is right and wrong and best for our kids. She has a certain self awareness that is evident all the time. We of course fight all the time one does, but even in these times, I can still see that her anger is so thin and some times transparent, and I see only love. I have a feeling that our savior, even when rebuking those for their own good, has of course mastered this same ability and I"m greatful for my wife to show that to me. Now, If I can just convince her to rub my feet, I'll be home free.  I love my wife and am greatful for having her in my life.

Another funny side effect of getting married, is that your family is suddenly quadruples in size. I hadn't ever really spent a lot of time thinking about the fact that I would have in-laws.  

For some reason over the last few months, I keep thinking about Captain Moroni and his life and challenges. Here was some one with such great strength and presense that people would follow him and be inspired by him.  I would love to have the opportunity to just sit for 10 minutes with his mother, and see what kind of person she was. I'd love to know more about her.  

MORE TIME?
I found a talk by a much younger Thomas S Monson, from a Conference in 1973 that spoke about mothers:

President Monson had two stories I wanted to share with you:
https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1973/10/behold-thy-mother?lang=eng&query=mothers#watch=video

One night at a champagne supper, when many were becoming intoxicated, someone in jest called for a toast from this young man. Colonel Higgenson said that he arose, pale but with perfect self-control, and declared: “Gentlemen, I will give you a toast which you may drink as you will, but which I will drink in water. The toast that I have to give is, ‘Our mothers.’”

Instantly a strange spell seemed to come over all the tipsy men. They drank the toast in silence. There was no laughter, no more song, and one by one they left the room. The lamp of memory had begun to burn, and the name of “Mother” touched every man’s heart.

As a boy, I well remember Sunday School on Mother’s Day. We would hand to each mother present a small potted plant and sit in silent reverie as Melvin Watson, a blind member, would stand by the piano and sing, “That Wonderful Mother of Mine.” This was the first time I saw a blind man cry. Even today, in memory, I can see the moist tears move from those sightless eyes, then form tiny rivulets and course down his cheeks, falling finally upon the lapel of the suit he had never seen. In boyhood puzzlement I wondered why all of the grown men were silent, why so many handkerchiefs came forth. Now I know. You see, mother was remembered. Each boy, every girl, all fathers and husbands seemed to make a silent pledge: “I will remember that wonderful mother of mine.”

I love these words - as I read them, I can here President Monsons voice, he has that kind of voice that you want to listen to, yet at the same time you know that when you listen your soul is going to be completly opened subject to correction. I imagine President Mons's mother spoke to him in the same way, teaching him of the power he could have to teach others.

I'm greatful that we live in an earth where we can teach each other what the savior must be like through our own actions. It's cool that 
we can help others gain a testimony by trying to act as he would. When we were commanded to be perfect, he wasn't joking around, and meant what he said. What an amazing blessing it is that we have Mothers to help show us the way.

I know that Jesus Christ is our savior. I know that this Church is true. I love my family, I'm so greatul for my amazing wife and the oportunity to see her fulfil the role of Mother that I knew she would do so well at.  I'm greatful that my own mother impressed upon me how important it is to love both your children and spouse.

Every time I comfort my kids (under my wife's watchful eye), I still feel my mothers arms around me, and hope that my kids can feel at least some of that incredible love.

I repeat President Mons words, I will remember that mother of mine.

I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ Amen 

:-)
