$$$ CONVERSATIONS $$$$  -ADAM
This is the list of things I want to tlak about 

Next highest priority:
 - identity of male and female is significan't but apparently not necessarially fixed; as some are to deal with that particular stuggle; whih we call  genetic variation, even in anatomy, 3 boobs 2 penises, or both sexes.
 - Sexual prefreence is interesting to me to sides of this, I walways wanted to ask a gay person particualr qieonts, if you dont mind, I have a few - also, my own secual preferences and how they came about.
 - Upset that more taking about sex isn't done; It was just always taboo thing; I remember I think yo uand bethany were just terrified about he way that we'd think about you - do you have anything to add to thiat?
  - My story

Adam K conversation:
podcast
items discussed
 - 50/50 rule
 - Ontology

Next on stage:
 - Gender roles and sexual tendencies.
 - Spending time on a talent.

This conversation is going to be a bit jumping around in nature; I have a lot we haven't chatted about. 

First let me ask you a question: is there anything that you choose not to talk about? is there anything out of bounds?

 - First I have to to say a few things: I was surprised how fast I identified you was one of my 6 people or so for two reasons, aside from having the benefit of years of history:
     - 1 I can talk to you about anything, there are no limits to what we can chat about at any level. I have many people that some subjects are so hard for them to have a meta discussion because they can't pause portions of their brain long enough to fully explore an idea.  Example of Leah and my mechanis question about the atonement.
     - 2 I am actually experiencing a surprising amount of a nervous excitement, so thank you for your time. I never thought that I would enjoy conversation with so much.

Before we start, I realized when I listeden to this podcast, it really is a subset of a of book I read by Ekhart Tolle called the Power of Now. - in the same way that a time management book is a subset to the 7 habits book. I don't agree with everything he says and got pretty close to what I think is the truth, but unfortunately everything has to be boiled down to crappy language; and words get in the way.

MASSIVE Key: stop resisting the now,  - Kehart tolle's key note was about this; but tolle also said don't give time to your problems: Anxiety is just an emotion with time added.

Loved it: not supposed to worry about our cyhildren's anxienty: THEY have to feel this. Not quite 5050 in different times; but overall about 5050.

Wow - Worth of the experience of life: to experienc.e

This ties into one of my theroeis: Experiences is exponeitally more vaiubale than we think it is; botht he pain and the pleasure.  I belive that the savir experiended both the pain and the pleasuer - he had to feel everything to be in the position that he is.

Reali

 - Loved her diferentiation with the gun to the head thing - howe anxiety is about a problem int he future: the gun to the head really displays that well: Ekhart tolle wote a whole book actually called the pwoer of now that tlks all about the now being the onlything that exits, and human beings add past and future, and get sick because of it.
Future ONLY exists in our minds; it's up for grabs!Brain likes things that are predictable. the Uknown is a form of death.
     - Ekhart tolle says if you could ask an animal what time it is, they'd always say "the time is now."

Anxiey is a secondary emotion - Im glad you broght this up, this is a whole conversation for another day; I think emergency responders 

Resisting casues secondary axniety: "Lean into the emotion and be willing to experience it" BEAUTIFUL.
"Where is that emotion in my body?"
Again, echart tolle talks about this as a portal - OOH OOOH - when an ochrastra finishes a particularly beautiful stong, there's a moment of silence between the last note and the clapping.  THAT is a portal; I've always loved that time, but I coudln't ever figureout why it was so significant to me.
This is exactly what ekarhtol calls the Power of now: living completely in the now, and refusing to give time to your thoughts. 

Feeling negative emotion is NOT a problem; this is our design from God.

Some times, duality is the quoted reason: that good and bad define themselves from each other. Ekhart tolle doesn't agree with this: he believes duality is a constract of the mind; and should be avoided: instead of seaking happiness and avoiding sadness, we should seek peace.  He also believes that God isn't a person, but a construct that exists in a combination of all of us.

Negative emotion from other people: doesn't matter 

These survibal mechansims are misapplied here: we're not running from lions and elephants.

Opposition in all things - 

I didn't like that she lumped the word Piece in the Good.

50% of the time normal to be negative . . .

Entitlement whole discussion for naother day: I loved this.  Entitement to feel good.

She sais that duality helps define joy and hapiness and I think I agree with this, except tolle talks about this third option to leave the duality entirely: Piece and joy he said dont' have an opposite . .

Knoweldge of opsoition: and supposed to feel bad

MASSIVE Key: stop resisting the now.

Side note: Heard that when people don't mangae their mind, they typcially will turn to pleasuere, masturbation, porn acholotl or some other equally addictive or otherwise damanging response becaues they're looking for deep meaning.  IN m opinion, smart pepeole will become imemdiately disatisifed when they see the temporary and hollow nature.

 - I finally found the word that describes my current obsession: ONtology: the branch of metaphysics that discusses the nature of being.  This, above all else facinates me to no end. The recent converence with Nelson saying that personal relevation is now a mater of surviavl really lit the fire in my mind about this. I feel an actual hunger to learn more. 
 - whole LGTBY thing - what if my sexual preferences or desires were suddenly identified almost as a race like  this group has been? would I publically identify msyelf with that group? Would I potentlly be shunned?

\- Dualism: Just read about this: the fact that reality has more than jsut a physical component - website of peole that are tryin to reason out if there is actually a different plane of being fir something like the spirit, or like 6 other items. 

 - Love of aritstry above
 - Met a guy named Shannon - hes technically an inactive member, but is one of the most kind, loving people I know.  He and his wife have been a part of probably a part of every reltiiogn.
 - Met antoher dude named Jermoe Cartegnea at a clicent site a while ago, pinted me at some oned nmaed Jordan Peterson.  
\- Zone Proximal Ddevelopment or ZPD - in a position to be pushing all the time.
\- Used to think the lds church had a monopoly on truth; it's not quite rithe, the lds chursh has the complete truth, though truth can be found in lots of places. For example: many religions Budusts, and others really place a lot of importance on keeping a clear space in mind: Ekhart tolle is another guy that does hit.

Now were where I wanted to be.  This internal quiet space I believe is where reality is the most real. It's where we experience pleasuer and pain, its the place that temptation is acepted or deflected. OUr responsability then is to be masters of keeping this place at peace - notice I didn't say happy, a better word is probably Joy - you know, the long term joy that I think is a byproduct of this piece, and yes, ends up resulting in me being happy, but its' jsut biproduct not necesarialy the goal.

Anywho - our bodies facilitate this space very nicely; in fact they do these items:

 - Physical needs
 -Apanately Completely re-write what 'me' is.
 - Limits our perceptions.
 - causes a type of persistent aloneness 

 - Physical needs: for most of time, it's kept us in this shared relaity - while there are machines and ideas that can minmize this, it still has to be dealt with: it can't be eliminated. Our bodies require constant renewing, rebuilding, exercise, sleep.
    Needed to keep us here; otherwise we could all agree to interact completely thourhg a game like call of duty, and completely shrugg off this reality.
 - Completely implicitly re-writes what 'me' means: We had to be given a clean slate: our clear space had to be fully assigned to us to give this life meaning. I think it's a big reason why we weren't all given the abilty to read minds: there may be some exceptions, but it isn't universally available.
   Needed to allow us to give us a clean slate on what and who we are (some will never even recognize this)
 - Lmits our perceptions: I get the feeling our spirit selves are so deeply perceptive in so many ways, that it was difficult to improve in our state. I think our 5 sesens tends to really limit us as far as what we can percieve.  we tend to believe relaity only contians physical textures, sounds, colors, smells and tastes; I believe there are levels and capacities of perception that are completely unfathomable to us now.
    Needed to create a separation between us and God; and to give us a capacity for failure.
 - causes aloneness: being squashed into these bodies makes it so that we appear to live completely on our own: we can see, talk, have sex with, fight, play, whatever; an all of these in any number of ways.
    needed to create needed areas of growth: communication, expression of all sorts, ability to connect to another human being; the requirement of selfe intros pection, then the skill of verbalizing that in cases.

Now were to one of my favorite subjects, and some odd ephipanies - I say odd because they ring true to the deepest part of my coul, but my brian hasn't caought up yet.
1 - Pain has an highly valuable purpose in life; possibly exponentially more than we realize.
     - part B to this, I think that we had a big part in chosing what our pain would be - yes; even the people that are getting raped all the time, and thse with addictions so bad they can't live their lives; all by choice.
2 - Raw experience is huge; possibly exponentially more than we realize.
3 - Repentenance and genuine change have real meaning in this separate state we call life.
4 - the atonement was real and necessary.

1 - all the bad things that happen in the word, of course ar ehorrible; but they're not horrible in the way we think they are.  Some say how can God allow a life where there is so much pain?  The real questoin to ask, is what more can I do to have god with me as I expereince my pain, and to help minimize the pain of others? God is giving us salvation; and pain plays a significan't role in this; though I can't say why.

2 - Just living on this planet is valuable for us.  Everything from an orgasm to stubbing your toe, to sending a letter, hugging your kids, shoveling snow, fighting aexhaustion; all of it has value.  I hestiate a little just to try to make sure that I"m not trying to event a reason or purpose behind my pain just because I want there to be one; but this still seems right to me.

3 - IN this state of separation and lonelyness, any and all moves we make towards god, even millimeters of change are deeply good for us.  A recent saying in a book that I live summbed up a man that was realy struggling with some horrible things he had done in his life: He told himself, Stand up and be better. such an simple expresison of sloughing off excuse, and a simple command to improve.

4 - Something about the atonment rings so deeply in sideme - like with all my doubths and frustation, this single truth seems to melt a hole in the secenter of what I call me.

 - Book: We are legion we are bob: about  Vonnoymin probe . .

Shannon conversation
 - so I have like 5 people in my life that I can have real, meaningful conversations with, and you are one of them.  So I need to start by sayin thank you; you hae just the right kind of mind for lots of conversations . . 
 - Naiive.
    Growing up, I've been really naive. I guess most peple are, but this nievness persistend most of my life.  Just in the last 15 years so, things have really changed for me. I think I used to derive my identity from the church for example: in my mind, the truthfulness of the church or the lack of it defined me as smart or dumb, valid or not valid.
    I think most pople are like this; but it has this bad result in causing really crappy naieve judgements. To give you an example, I once saw my dad had hidden a twelve pack of beer on the boat, and I fell apart: while the distancing from alcohol came from teh church I still reacted so poorly, and judged my dad so crapily. I essentially came craying to my dad in ront of everyone at the campfilre, just a big emotional mess - I think I was like 15; definately old enough to have crappy judgements, but I twas bad.
 While I'm upset i'm finally learning this now, I'm 40, and feel like I"m behind.

I've now had the chance to travle quite a bit, and to tal kwith a lot of people that, while different than me, have given me such incredible insight, and even a deep happiness, and the chance to be a better person, becuase I've been given so many point of views.

I recenly found my nephew was in some pretty hard times: lots of drugs, alchool sex, everything - he just about go tot the point where he was going to kill some one becuase of how they treated his sister; and If I were in his shoes, I don't know if I would have done anything any differently.

My point in telling you about him is that he essentially has no religion in his life.  We spent a lot of time talking about how some one puts together a personal construct that they can follow to give them purpose an meaning: for him, it was entirely based on loyalty an love; in the best way he knew how, and to be completely honest, I don't think I could have come to a different coclusion than he did; despite how horrible the result of his decision was - to end someones life.

 - Personal questionable 
    - If you don't mind, I'd like to ask yo usome personal questons? if you don't mind I' dlike to be kinda blunt; if I begin offend you in ny way, please ask me to stop and I will. There questions about core beliefs.
    - I've talked with a lot of pepole, some in the church, some out of the church; and I've been fasciainated to see that people are so stuck in their relgion and have ther identity derived by it, that if I were tosay the church is false, or anything that might even be kinda shady about joseph smith,, or the book of mormom, and the would physically fall apart.  I do personally believe that the church is true, joseph smith was awesome, thoguh somewonat of an ative fellow, and that the book of mormon is true; but that' snot even my pint: some people CANT even separate them selves from it.

    I've notied that your family is a member of the church but don't attend very often. If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you two questions
     - how much do you believe in God, and his nature,
     - What would you say your relationship with the church is? I sthere a reason why you guys don't go? 
I need to apologize, my goal here is more selfish at the moment and it isn't necessarialy to push you to the church; but to understand. (long period). 

Were you raised in the church? 
If the church isn't providing your basis for choice making in life, can I ask what you base your believes on? What constract have you put together for yourself to make decisions

I've learned a bit about Objectivisim, and what Ayn Rand teaches: and to be honest, It seems like pretty solid stuff if you completely ignore faith. I'm a computer programmer, and am a simple direct dude; and I've always struggled with faith.  I don't really lke the lemming mentality: where I'm just a puppet bein controled. That bohters me.
Ekhart Tolle is another guy that seems to have come to very simliar conlcusions; both ayn Rand and Ekhart tolle have come to the conlsuion, that in objectivisim; 'each of is is the 'hero' is how they explian it: that god isn't a separate being, but that you are essentially a piece of God.  I do believe in a separate being; but I think this is a relaly interesting way to see things; and some cool conslusions that people have come to on their onw. Granted, they're somewhat lacking in the religions stile of faith; but are solid.

Are you familial with their beliefs? what do ou think?

My ultimate point with this conversation is this:
 - Real, true, deep and lasting happiness comes from many sources. I used to think that the church had a monopoly on the truth, and indirectly happiness; and now I've revised that belief to I believe now that the church does have the truth and  focuses on the truth that has the most lasting happines; but truth can be found anywhere; and I've found a lot of people that are different from me in some way; but have so much greatness, love and patience, but either haven't heard about the church, or choose not to be a part of it. this simple fact has really opened my mind; and has caused me to want to collect these people, and be friends with them all; its rare though that I find someone like you that I think can have and appreciate this kind of conversation.  

I cna shut up now, but I have a whole noter subject I'd like to chat about. I can shut up too if you prefer.

NATURE OF RELAITY ABOVE

 - The nature of reality.
    This one is just a set of musings really; but has made me se relality deifrently.
    This really is a question of  perception vs raw existance: two peple can of couse have an entirely different reactoin or point of voiew to the same experience: it goes back to the tree falling in a forest and if it makes a sound. The capacity for sound is there, but I think some definitions of sound include the vibrations being interpreted by a person. My point though is that we appear to all be separate conciousnesses going about in a word where we can see and hear each other (among other things) - and we all appear to have our own conciousness; our own 'quiet space' where decisions can be made.
First, this quiet space we have is a key point to our existance, but that's another conversatoin for another day.

 - A peronsons' quiet space.
    Seems to be a huge part of why we aere put into these bodies: we had to be in a position where we can interact with others and a seemingly inamitte world; and we appear to be completely alone.  It does a few things:
 - We have the posibiliy for failire and making mistakes.
 - We can become susecptiable to sin.
 - We can become susceptaible to the spirit.

 - Does over communication scare some people?
     - Crying in the work place
     - Communicating within different groups (inlaws . . work . . etc)

\- Michael conversation:
     - Would you say that you are a happy person? I am not implying that I think you are happy or depressed, it's more of a conversation about where you define meaning.  If you are happy, you've obviously defined a set of values that you've followed through with - 7 habits I;d ugess.  If not, I'm curious what your disconnect is.  I had a long chat with a few people about happiness.  Some are so ingraned in religion that I think they mah have a mask of happiness.  Some have no religion whatsoever, so loyalty, and simple love and respeect for faimly and friends is what was used as a basis there.
  - your comment about crying on the way home realizing the rest of your life is pushing seven habits; may ahve been an expression of sadness; but seems also like an immense clarity.  Being on the recieving end of the 7 habits push, I can see it only as a positive thing.  Extreemly difficult; but deeply positive, and I'd assume that you'd be able to get some happiness from the natrual results of others at least attempting to follow the 7 habits.

\- Brent conversation:
want to be super blunt; don't really have time to dilly dally here.
      - I've had a lot of things happen to me:
 - Beginning of June crash
 - Mid JUne tle rec gone; leave ch
 - as we've talked about a little - addiction
 - I've decided to stop even though there is a possibility that health wise the behavior may be completely normal and ok; I simply have too much of an addictive personality to keep doing it, and it is
not inline with my core values, despite what the church says.
      - I personally know that I"m the kind of person, that if I try something, and I like it at all; I will most likely be addicted very quickly.
 - I considered sce twice - in a complete mire of helplessness.
 - After this, I considered leaving the church; that anything paranormal is a load of BS, and lost my faith.
      - I even decided who in my family I'd decide to tell, and started creating a new beliefe structure.
      - Only in this state a few days; but it was the most mentally distressing time of my life - more than deaths in the family, and mom and dad's divroce etc . .
   I was really ambivalent towards the church - questining my testimony was a new place for me.
 - Leahs parents have helped uqite a bit; we have a great relationship.
 - I've sense got on some medication for anx dep - ecitalopram - lexapro.
 - still don't have my recommend; though when I do get it back, It'll be the most healthy time Iv'e ever been: because I want it for me; not because my religion says I should have it.
 - See hope now, and I feel like I understand pain, depression, anxiety, suicide on a wholew new level now; to a point where I'm left only with deep grattitude and piece, and a realization that Jesus and the atonement aren't just nice words we throw around; but are real, and deep frameworks to endgender real happiness; not just after we die, but right now.
 - I say all this because I I'm so far past guilt shame, and pain, that I"ve talked freely about all of these items with 3 really close friends of mine.  The fact that we can talk about mb with another guy really feels like a change in times; right? like there's a sense of needing to change in the air for lack of better terminology.

 - I'm continually overwhelmed by the severe lack of a definition of what a normal life should be: God really left it up in the air; with some guidlines as to how we're supposed to act; yet EVERY SINGLE DANG PERSON ON THE PLANET is going to have very different, very difficult life changing experiences; where the rules seem overly simplistic, not applicable, or simply up for interpretation. This has convicned me, that we decide what our reality is going to be.  Here's where we could branch off into Ontology, defining conciousness and relaity, and I'm gearing up to possibly start a podcast about it; but we don't have time; we'll chat about this portion later - Do you remember my comment about how smoking cannibis changes your reality, and you said no, it's 99% in your brain? This conversation deeply fasciantes me; but we don't have time.

More importantly, now fully and truely value things that are really important to me; I can now list what I truely value;
      - My character, intelligence, wisdom, relationships, experiences, and my faith in the atonement. 
      - I haven't fully removed all of my ambivalence towards the church but have been able to separate people and logistical elements from the core doctrine quite nicely, and that's helping repair me.

 I've crashed so hard, any amount of judmental-ness I had is gone.  NOw there is only piece, grattidue, and clear thought for the first time in my life; thoug that may just be the ecitalopbram.

 - On this note
 - our parents can't keep what may have been a secret - comments of you havinv a relationship with a lady, possibly ahving a baby - I wnt to get to know her, to hug her and say think you for giving you some happiness and pleasure. If this is true, hold your baby, help buy diapers - When you are happy, sad, proud, ashamed, high, drinking, not drinking, I have a desire to be a part of your happienss and pain on all sides.  The one thing I can promise you always is complete love and understanding. 
     I have seriously considered smoking cannibis with you because I care so much about being completely open and sharing our lives; yet, per my addiction sensitivity, I should probably stay away , again despite what the church or laws say.

Podcasts:

11/8/2018 10:50:46 AM - Conversation went well yesterday; we ended up walking around block of new office twice, and having an excellent very open conversation.
