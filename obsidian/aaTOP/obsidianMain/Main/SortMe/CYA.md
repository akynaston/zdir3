Heather 8/23/2018 9:40:01 AM- No apopintments for kids tomorrow; just before this called revere health; no appointments.

8/23/2018 4:49:28 PM- Brent called from machens office - telling me tomorrow as Holly's appointment for him!! I requested to cancel and BRent said it wouldn't be an issue.

11/7/2018 9:22:31 AM - Lady working on Holly's IEP. I spoke with her today; apparently there are some missing test names on her IEP, and that made the district upset.Â  As of now, I'm considering this resolved; they just need to get the test names written in to make the district happy.
