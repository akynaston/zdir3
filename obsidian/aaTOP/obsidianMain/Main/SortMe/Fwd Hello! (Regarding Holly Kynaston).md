I hope you all enjoyed your nice long weekend.  It was really great to visit with each of you last week.  I have seen tremendous growth in everyone in our class.
Please keep up the great work at home. It really makes a difference.  These third graders are becoming great readers!  Also please continue to help them learn their times tables.  They need to have all the facts through 12 memorized by the end of 3rd grade.  We take a timed test everyday.  I give them 1 minute to complete the paper they have been bringing home.
For Valentine's Day we will be making valentines boxes at school.  If you have any empty cereal boxes at home, please send them to school with your child as soon as possible.
Here are some items to be aware of:
February 12th - Field Trip (Play at Scera & Skating)
February 13th - Valentine's Party
February 16th - Presidents' Day (No School)
February 25th - Half Day for Students
Enjoy your week!
Mrs. Knotts
