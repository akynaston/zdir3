# Priesthood notes

Having a clear and high quality state of conciousness is the precursor to feeling the spirit, making a good deciision. All choices are made in one of three states. High, low ignorant. State of mind us everey thing.  It is our own choice to set the state of mind we will feel and think.
The state of mind we choose is our own reality. We need to conciously decide who when and how our state changes
There's no uhaul foowing our herse
Why do we do what we do? Fear? Love? Ingnotance? Impatience? To be seen? Because we see truh that needs to be expressed?  "spank that kid!!!". Andrews frown is a starkly clear mirror.
Think about their hearts. Thus is what matters, not the time not the material things
Death bed mental clarity. Why can't we have this state of mind all the time???!!
Listen with love and clarity. No regrets.  
Learn to love your trials.
