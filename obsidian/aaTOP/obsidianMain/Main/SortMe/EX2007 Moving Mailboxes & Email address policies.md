# EX2007: Moving Mailboxes & Email address policies.

If you move a mailbox from Exchange 2003 or Exchange 2000 to Exchange 2007, and the mailbox is part of an e-mail address policy, the e-mail addresses for that mailbox will be automatically updated based on the configuration of the e-mail address policy. If the mailbox had a primary Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) address that differs from the e-mail address enforced by the e-mail address policy, that SMTP address will become a secondary SMTP address and the e-mail address generated by the e-mail address policy will become the primary SMTP address. This behavior is different from Exchange 2003 and Exchange 2000. In Exchange 2003 or Exchange 2000, the e-mail address policy is not applied to a mailbox when it is moved. To prevent accidentally changing the primary SMTP address of a mailbox in an Exchange 2007 environment, you must configure the mailbox so that is does not automatically update e-mail addresses based on e-mail address policy. To configure Exchange 2003 or Exchange 2000 mailboxes, in **Active Directory Users and Computers**, right-click the recipient, and then select **Properties**. On the **E-mail Addresses** tab, clear the **Automatically update e-mail addresses based on e-mail address policy** check box.
