# 2021: reducing distractions

Thoughts on 2021

I have some random thoughts.
      - probably the greatest source of anxiety, and my biggest request of you two is to make a request; not even sure how to voice it; I suppose it falls under more clear and precise feedback; but that's not quite right.
      - the summary is that I'm a expensive liability, don't want to carry around this label any more feeling a little powerless to resolve.

\*\*\*On me to be proactive about meetings . . .
      - timing of issues come up during high stress.
      - DVE issue - I was off in the weeds
           - Two releases - deployed - immediately basic functaiontliy busted . .
           - one issue with deployment
           - DVE - really behind on the deliverable . . .
     - diapaer analgoy - aaron has a pooopy diaper - melt down . .

      - thought a lot about what you said that I'm a widget tuner - I really am.  That's what I love doing. I realize the nature of our business doesn't necessarily lend itself to widget turning; though I think I've just been lucky to be doing IDM for so long.

      - I already have a relatively clear indication when I'm not in a good state; like with the Census ting about being on call; I sensed only anxiety, and thought that pooping out an email to everyone would help reduce it, when I simply violated "seeing first to understand", and pushed the anxiety to you first.

Empathetic problem . .
 - capacity issues . .

AARON:  despite capacity issues - need to have discussion
      - Mental reset - introduce gap between stimulous and response
          need to introduce gap . . .

New meeting today 1/14/2021 9:49:52 AM

I'd like to give a quick summary, and what I would like to work on, and I would like to talk about dev plan stuff; but can I give a summary first about my capacity?
      - Quick summary: overall our discussions revolve around my capacity.
While anxieyt and depression are bad, they're not the core problem - it's that anxiety depression are just two ways that I tend to spiral then lose all control.  Even during something such as standup I feel a relatively high level of anxiety. Any time I'm with 3 or more people regardless of who they are there seems to be anxiety; but thats a discussion for another day.

 - research fitbit - 

     So detecting this sprial and avoiding it seems to be my goal. I need to get in the habit of detecting and avoiding it - I"m getting my alsavers account and will go see a shycyatrist again - it's been helpfu in the past.
      - On Tuesday I managed to forget my meds, so I was more unstable; I knew it affected me, but Tusesday was a good indication of how much.
      - I'm also going to test increasing my meds. I realized I forgot my meds on Tuesday and was more unstable than normal; starting this weekend when I can confirm the updated perscription.

As we talk, and from now on I have a desire to keep a close eye on this spiriling and find ways to reset: fi you need to tell me something, at a minimim I should be able tos eek to understand while I reset.
      - Whenever we have these kinds of meetings I do have a great deal of anxiety. so I'm watching it.

I believe that it is mandatory that I hear and understand what is going wrong.  Ideally, if something caome up, you'd would just tell me about it, and I'd earn make the apporpriate changes and move on.

Let me give a little more context
      - LIke we mentioned I tend to be a widget turner. I'm not yet talking about if this is good or bad or not, it's just truth and speaks to my state mental preference
      - So I was just thinking my last time that I was in a widget turning project, was probably some BAES stuff and specifically the first release of the SOU.

I say this only because Working on Census has been quite different than other projects and means I'm not in my widget turning comfort mode and I haven't been in the habit of watching this.

With this context, let me talk more about Census
      - It's taking me a longer than expected to come up to speed. Just within the last month or so have I really started feeling I have some traction, yet every day I'm seeing the evnironment is so much bigger than I knew.
      - I was under the impression that Wilie would be ecstatic to assign things out to other people; but have found recently that I do need to likely dig and prod for work; which he responds to very well.
           - I realize I need to build more trust with him by totally nailing everything he hands off; but at the same time, most handoffs I need to ask pretty specific questions.  He's a pretty chaotic thinker like me.

dev plan:

last minute thing: last mentioning . . .

Availability - 
\*\*\*      - CSR - Learn about certifiate singing request
      - RPM . . .
      - Python - 
     Personal goal: delivery: rpm - delivery packaging - hoiw to make jenkins work . .
          non trivial thing . . .
           - At a personal plan level I"m  interested in delivery and packaging - specificlaly rpms, build scripts, things like that that reduce manual steps.
           - Our BAES drivers do a whole tun of set up during driver startupa, nd it saved a lot of trouble.
           - As we get closer to haveing a delivery server, I'd like all my stuff to be dlievery server friendly; not sure if that menas I need to start using maven, or have a way to run idmunit tests in my ant scripts . .
      - Learn how to package an RPM . . .
   - build server maybe comes in as an idea - this is just one tool to build out a solution . . .

Team level:
      - I know travle to DC is discouraged right now; I do think Is hould still continue to document technical items to talk about out there.
           - document DC items out there
           - Traveling to DC - no one out there . . .
           - could go to raleigh to work on someting . .
     L&L - only an hour - but if bigger - half a day - arrive at 10 and leave at 3 . lunch . .
          Glen worries - people left out on the DC . . .
      - effective doing training.
\*\*\*\*\*\*            - get training put together . . . to be done over zoom - go whever I want to go - tommy went to hawwi - positive & negative test . . .
     See clear plan before it goes out . . .

      - antibody resistance - year to 18 months - hunder & tcell - 10 years . . .

 - library: make my case for a grid of expertise . . .can sprial out of control . . .
      - say on standup . . .
      - Focus on the gap part of it instead . . .
      - NOvell right as we left - tried to put together skills inventory, big failure . .
      - cateories have to be small . . .

      - in my lane - I"m awesome . . .improve things - stability . . .

     I realize the library idea is kinda my go-to for the team level, but I like the teaching and resource aspect, but I haven't made it official or created any kind of video library of trainings.
      - REally like to spread the technical procedural stuff for way we do things.
            - Patrick MOnkelban is asking for a session today on how to setup IdMUnit today.
           - I realize
           - we still seem to have the problem of first knowing who knows what, and then getting some solid information in short videos.
            - Might be nice to have not just the lunch and learn; but to get more recorded, and stored in a library of how to do things; would be nice to give people instructions in a video.
            - LIke to come up with one on developoing for IdMUnit.

       - I've been thinking about creating a list that has every one on the compnay and list some expertise by each so some one could look at it, and reach out easier.
                 - Still see people struggling with things - of couse don' tmind if they ask me, but seems like it would be helpfu.
       - WE've started creating rules about how and when to contact people - I'd love to make the whole process super clear: like pinging some one on Im before calling or, caling before IM or something that minimizes distractions, but creates an easier way for people ot talk.

      - would also be helpful to decide which LUnch and Learns to create: we could see which expertise are really lacking across the company.

General distractions
     General depression and anxiety
     - still stricks me as really odd I would describe myself as a happy person, but of course the two things are disconnected; one is a personaltiy trate, and the other is a chemical imbalance. I have obviously been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, so I can do something about it along with medication.
    - they both change a little over time, and I'm still trying to match the right meds to be on; though I have to balance it with being completely apathetic towards most evertyhing.  If I take too much I"m just a blob.

     - I find I have to take a slightly lower amount than I'd like to help mute things, but still means I need to deal with both. it also does make me sleepier; thought this would be a more direct process, and change is slow.
     - I think I pressure myself pretty hard to provide for my family, so I think these kinds of conversations are deeply anxiety filled for me - as I think about it, having a conversation with people like you that I respect, I think would be enjoyable to some degree, though I also have this strong sense that I'm walking around with poo in my diaper for quite some time, and that my working her is at risk, which is another huge source of anxiety.

 - Crapy health and Sleepiness level.
     - of course suspect this has quite a bit to do with my health.  I'm toying with the idea of a spin class and getting a membership at a close gym for a spin class. I've taken it before, and it has helped with sleeping and general health issues; but is difficult setting side time, balancing with Leah's time, time with fam and sleeping time.
      - today feeling pretyt good except for some terrible alergies.  Ceterizine seems to work ok - loratadine works better but makes me tired; so still trying to find the balance there. Need to try maybe even half a loradadine twice a day or something slimiar.

 - Wife management
      - Made some excellent progress on finances. Despite still having trouble getting her on board with getting things in ynab, I do review it at least weekly to stay on top of things, and it has given me quite a bit of relife to remove my self rom the equation, and have her show me her choices work in ynab.
      - Been learning about what sets off my frustration and anxiety with her. She does not yet see the severity of my hours spent sleeping yet; but I do understand her unexpectede resistance; and I've found ways to begin to meet her expectations better which will lead to me sleeping more hours.

You said something that confused me - You made it sounds like I was spending too much effort on tracking my FTO when I said I was over last year. All I did was to add it, and training to my yearly timecard utilization thing to have a better picture of everything I wanted to track. 
     I have it in my timing spreadsheet now, and it probably took a very small fraction of time to track it.

I don't want poo in my fto diaper and so do need to have some sort of measurement to help make decisions.

I've added training to that lsit too, so that's helpful - just to balance hours throughout the year.
      - 

client discussion
BAES - while a difficult client, we already have relatively strong frameworks in place, and mutlip.e people that I cna work with to get things right.

SOU - Both anxious and excited about new technology.  You and I spent a lot of time in putting together what I thought was a clear plan, albiet there's a relatively large mount of work to do that I didn't plan or document yet.  After the first release, when I started ont he second I think then would have been good to spend a little more time on manging expectations.

 - Census
     - ON eveyr other poject I have quite a framework of resources. I don't seem to have that at Census. If I need clarity on something, It normally requires more time from Willie. While habit 5 says I need to seek first to understand then be understood it just takes more time from Willie.
         - over the hollidays, i I just now realized the level of anxitey I feel any time Census comes up - I know that I'm going to be
     - I realized Willie is put in a situation where needs to trust me to run with something, and from what you guys have said, that trust is likely already damaged.
     - Also - lots of random email sent to the groups I'm a part of, yet I don't have any sense for helping out the team as I imagine my predecessor may have done.
        - very high level of noise - normally, a proactive stance of picking up the quesitons and running with them is the appropate thing to do; I realize Willie and Monique are my may containcts, and I"m really needing to direct efforts towards what they ask for, but I end up floating ina  pool of vagery that I don't feel like I can fully nail down without costing willie the time to run with it on is own anyway.

Goals 
     personal - Really interested in the delivery process - that would include Git or svn, build, automated tests and delivery, all the way from source to rpm or whatever the result is.
     Team - Census related: there is a lot of stuff going on at Census all the time.  A few times I've reached out to ask Willie if I can help on something and he says yes, that would be helpful - I still haven't gotten to the point where I can actually take things off of his plate, and I'd like to get there.

More personal toughts from MarcoPolo

Personal notes
REcently had a huge bout of depression. I'm currently on medication to deal with depression and anxiety, and It seems to work pretty good.
A few days ago, I forgot to take it, and also had an employee review.
 - Carl and Brent are employees in the same company so I shouldn't say too much; but the bototm line is that there are a few things I need to do better as an employee.

Dorel thoughts:
 - some days harder than others - bad days in a row; done with this.
 - what is coming later?
