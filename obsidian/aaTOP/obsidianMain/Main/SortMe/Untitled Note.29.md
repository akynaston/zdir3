# Untitled Note

InTowards end of year of 2018 - Helped Joong pick a better plan for upgrading: using eDirectory replication rather than creating a difficult driver.

* Required udnerstanding of eDirectory replication and the eDirectory bidrectional and legacy drivers to recommend the best idea.

* Throughout the year - worked with Colton to pick up the updated Powershell driver,a nd answer questions about the old powershell driver.
* Halfway through the ForgeRock training - chapter 4 of 7; but I did go ahead and let the rest of the videos play in the crappy player and got the badge.
* Throughout the year - continued to help on BAES as needed - there were some complicated bugs that needed to be reviewed, and I worked with Carl to get them resolved  - IDM job and IDM engine related items - answering questions that either requires experience or hours of trace review and knowing what the engine will do.
* There was some complicated FCPS trace review items I was able to help Colton on.
* Learned Git, and continue to learn a lot about core commands, maintaining the repo integrity, rebasing, merging the proper way, and adopting some healthy workflows to keep things clean.
	* Assisted multiple people with git questions - Jason, Alex and Chris have had quesitons that I've been able to help them work out - involving rebasing to resolve branch issues, and interactive rebasing to squahs commits and simply delete unwanted commits from history, while still maintaining a development branch at that point.
* Worked with Chris to push forward on our data center servers 
* Helped Michelle multiple times on eDirectory replication and IDM and IDMUnit questions.
	
* Maintained a cleaner office than normal - this really helps me concentrate.
* On the personal side of things, I've resolved some issues that were distracting me - has helped a great deal in my concentration.
	* find that I can be here fully, and know that I can give fair time my family and TriVir; I've struggled a bit with that in the past.

To do better:

* Biggest issue was my same trouble - where I'll dig forever on something before I have the project time to support the work.
* Second, related - not keeping the AC with me as a guide. Would have forced me to ask questions at the right time.
* Adopt similar svn workflow habits in Git - potentially could have saved some time.
* adopt a more disciplined management of time split between training and project time - I don't yet have a regular training time.
* I have a lot of open threads still - I need to visit each item more often and either push items off, or not do them if they aren't important enough.
* Personal side
	* Been sick a lot - not sure what to do here, other than to stay on top of my asthma meds, and maybe see a pulminaologyist - this seems to really goof up my concentration.
