**Printing Instructions:** Please print this form on _SINGLE-SIDED PAPER - double-sided printing will not be accepted. Compare the printed form to what appears on your screen. Make sure all data blocks and the barcode appear clearly and in the same format. If there are any distortions, smudges, missing blocks or data, and/or fading, it may be due to variations in printer types, printer drivers, and/or low ink levels. If such problems appear and cannot be corrected after checking your printer, do not submit the form. Instead, download a blank form and complete it by hand. See [Applications and Forms](http://www.travel.state.gov/passport/forms/forms_847.html)._
