# *** Primary lesson 2022-08-14

Hey Kids!  How are you today?

Are all of you going back to school this week?
Are you excited? Are you nervous? You will have a fun time, school is really good for you.

Do you guys remember what you talked about last week? did you talk about Job? Remember he had a really tough life, but was super failthful and still tried to do his best. Great stuff.

This week, we're moving on to a new book in the old testament. Can any of you read or pronounce this word?
PSALMS
Do any of you know what a psalm is?  

A psalm is a sacred song that is typcially a paayer to God.

Did you guys know that? That a song can be a prayer to god? Is that kinda funny?

Lets read an example for a second:

Pslam 23 has an interesting song:

PSALM 23
_David declares, The Lord is my shepherd._
A Psalm of David.

**1** The Lord _is_ my [a](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/23?lang=eng#note1a)[shepherd](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/23?lang=eng#note1a); I shall not [b](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/23?lang=eng#note1b)[want](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/23?lang=eng#note1b).

What is a shephard? What do shepahrds do? Do they bake cakes? Do they run marathons, or eat watermelon? 

A shepard is typcially someone that guides or leads animals, or really anything that needs to be gided around.  Have any of you seen a whole field of sheep before? They kinda wander a lot don't they? Alway swalking aroudn eating grass.
Well, a shepard can help the sheep stay together and not get lost. They help guide the sheep and help them stay together and under control. 
Do people need sheparads some times? Can people get lost?
I have a story for you.  for my Job, I had to go to Texas for a week, and had to get on an airplane.
    Have any of you guys ever been to the salt lake city airport? 
Well, it's not a super big airport, but they did make it a lot bigger lately!!

This is a picture of the salt lake Airport!  it's still not super big, but it's a bit different than before.  When I got home from texas, I was really tired, and I got lost.

![[./_resources/_Primary_lesson_2022-08-14.resources/unknown_filename.5.png]]

I got lost, and I really needed some help.  I was able to talk with some airort people,a nd they pointed me in the right direction.  it was really good to, becuase I was so tired, and ready to be home.  isn't that cool that we can help each other like that?

OK, so we read Pslams 23:1, lets read verse 5:

**5** Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou [a](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/23?lang=eng#note5a)[anointest](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/23?lang=eng#note5a) my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

## Invite Sharing

A few days in advance, invite a few children to bring to class drawings that represent things they and their families read about in the Psalms this week, such as a shepherd (see [Psalm 23:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/23.1?lang=eng#p1)), a cup (see [Psalm 23:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/23.5?lang=eng#p5)), or a heart (see [Psalm 24:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/24.4?lang=eng#p4)). Invite them to talk about their drawings and a verse from the Psalms that mentions them.

## Teach the Doctrine: Younger Children

[Psalms 19:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/19.1?lang=eng#p1)**;** [33:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/33.5?lang=eng#p5)

### **“The heavens declare the glory of God.”**

[Psalms 19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/19?lang=eng) and [33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/33?lang=eng) teach that we can find evidence of the glory and goodness of God all around us in His beautiful creations. Help the children learn to see God’s hand in the world around them.

#### **Possible Activities**

* Show the children some pictures of beautiful things God has created, or look out a window together to see these things. Ask the children what they love about Heavenly Father’s creations. Read either [Psalm 19:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/19.1?lang=eng#p1) or [33:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/33.5?lang=eng#p5), and ask the children how they feel about Heavenly Father when they see His creations.
* Sing together a song about God’s creations, such as “[The World Is So Lovely](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/childrens-songbook/the-world-is-so-lovely?lang=eng)” (_Children’s Songbook,_ 233). Invite the children to pick something God has created (such as something mentioned in the song) and draw a picture of it to share with their families.

[Psalm 23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/23?lang=eng)

### **“The Lord is my shepherd.”**

If the children can learn at a young age that the Lord is their shepherd, they will be more likely to follow Him “in the paths of righteousness.”

#### **Possible Activities**

* Give each child a copy of this week’s activity page, or give each of them a picture from the activity page. Invite them to listen as you read [Psalm 23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/23?lang=eng). Ask them to point to or hold up a picture when they hear it mentioned in the psalm. Bear your testimony that Jesus takes care of us, just as a shepherd takes care of his sheep.
* Tell the children some ways you know that the Savior loves you. Invite the children to stand one at a time and share some ways they know Jesus loves them. Sing together a song that could give them ideas, such as “[I Feel My Savior’s Love](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/childrens-songbook/i-feel-my-saviors-love?lang=eng)” (_Children’s Songbook,_ 74–75).

[Psalm 30:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/30.5?lang=eng#p5)

### **Jesus Christ can turn sadness into joy.**

Ponder how you will help the children gain their own witness of the joy Jesus Christ offers us when we are sad.

#### **Possible Activities**

* Invite the children to pretend to cry while you read from [Psalm 30:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/30.5?lang=eng#p5), “Weeping may endure for a night.” Then ask them to be joyful as you read, “But joy cometh in the morning.” Repeat this phrase a few times, and testify to the children that because of Jesus Christ, the sadness we feel in this life can be replaced with joy.
* Show a picture of the Savior, and tell the children about some of the things He has done for you that bring you joy. Give each child a turn to hold the picture and share what Jesus has done that brings them joy.

## Teach the Doctrine: Older Children

[Psalms 23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/23?lang=eng)**;** [27–28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/27?lang=eng)**;** [32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/32?lang=eng)**;** [46](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/46?lang=eng)

### **The Lord offers me peace, strength, and guidance.**

Many of the Psalms testify of the Lord’s blessings in our lives. You can use the Psalms to help the children learn to trust Him and turn to Him.

#### **Possible Activities**

* Write on the board _The Lord is_ _._ Let the children choose one or more of the following scriptures to read: [Psalms 23:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/23.1?lang=eng#p1); [27:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/27.1?lang=eng#p1); [28:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/28.1?lang=eng#p1); [28:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/28.7?lang=eng#p7); [32:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/32.7?lang=eng#p7); [46:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/46.1?lang=eng#p1). Ask them to complete the sentence on the board using what they learn from their scripture. Help the children discuss what these symbols teach us about the Lord.
* Show the children a picture of a lamb. Ask them to name some things a lamb needs to be safe and healthy, and encourage them to look in [Psalm 23:1–4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/23.1-4?lang=eng#p1) for ideas. Then show a picture of a child. What do we need to be spiritually safe and healthy? Read together [Psalm 23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/23?lang=eng), and ask the children how the things the shepherd does in this psalm could be compared to what Jesus Christ does for us.

![[./_resources/_Primary_lesson_2022-08-14.resources/unknown_filename.2.jpeg]]

We must be spiritually clean and pure to enter the Lord’s presence.
[Psalm 24:3–4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/24.3-4?lang=eng#p3)

### **To enter the temple, we need “clean hands, and a pure heart.”**

As the children look forward to entering the temple someday, help them understand that they can prepare by becoming spiritually clean through the Savior’s Atonement.

#### **Possible Activities**

* Show the children a picture of a temple. Invite them to read [Psalm 24:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/24.3?lang=eng#p3) and find words that remind them of the temple. Then read together [verse 4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/24.4?lang=eng#p4) to learn who can enter the temple (define any unfamiliar words). How do our hands get physically dirty? How do our hands and hearts get spiritually dirty? How do we clean our hands physically? How does the Savior help us clean our hands and hearts spiritually? (If it is helpful, explain that “hands” in this verse can represent our actions and “heart” can represent our desires.)
* Review with the children the requirements to receive a temple recommend (see Russell M. Nelson, “[Closing Remarks](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2019/10/57nelson?lang=eng),” _Ensign_ or _Liahona,_ Nov. 2019, 120–22; or invite a member of the bishopric to discuss these requirements with the class). Invite the children to choose one thing they feel inspired to do to prepare to be worthy to enter the temple.

[Psalm 46:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/46.10?lang=eng#p10)

### **“Be still, and know that I am God.”**

Taking time to be reverent and still, despite the busyness around us, can help us build our testimonies that God lives.

#### **Possible Activities**

* Help the children memorize the first line from [Psalm 46:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/46.10?lang=eng#p10): “Be still, and know that I am God.” Talk with them about what it might mean to “be still,” both physically and mentally. Share with the children an experience in which being “still” strengthened your testimony of Heavenly Father. Ask the children to share any experiences they have had. Why is being still an important way to know that God lives?
* Invite the children to review with you what they do during a typical day. Help them think of moments during their day when they could try to “be still” and feel close to Heavenly Father. Encourage them to set a goal to use such moments during the coming week to strengthen their testimony of Heavenly Father.
* Invite the children to list some things we can do to know for ourselves that Heavenly Father is real and that He loves us. Invite them to choose something from the list that they want to do.

## Encourage Learning at Home

Invite the children to choose a verse they like from the psalms they have talked about today. Encourage them to share that verse with a family member or a friend.
**Improving Our Teaching**
**Focus on the needs of the children.** As a teacher, you are in a unique position to understand the needs of those you teach. Your experience, your familiarity with the children, and the guidance of the Spirit will help you know which learning activities are most likely to build their faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
