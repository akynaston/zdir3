# Money Rules.

*  Spend less than we make.
	* This is a requirement, it isn't just a nice thing to say.
* Both agree to the budget as set up at the beginning of each 3 month or one month period.
* Both agree, or at least notify of category chnages by synching ynab app.
* Both agree to submit every cent spent  as soon as possible.
	* Do you want your account for Leah's wallet & bank account in ynab
* Both agree that we WILL NOT spend if a category shows we don't have the money.
	* Emergency savings CAN NOT be spent UNLESS we both agree to something.
		* An emergecny is something that MUST be paid for now: if there is another option to avoid spending savings, then it must be strongly considered.
