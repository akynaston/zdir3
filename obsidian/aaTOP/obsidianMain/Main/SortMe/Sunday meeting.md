# Sunday meeting

OUTLINE:

* I'm hear because I feel like I should be getting better; though I'm struggling with the desire.
* when I made this appt, it was to tell you I'm completely done with the church.
* After Friday June 1st fall apart: notes on disbelief & new system.
* Dred it's going to come back; the trigger struggles are still there.
* I'm burned out; while I think I have the capacity to make things like m calling great, just too much anxiety and I don't know what to do about it; and just want to hide. I'm done with the roller coaster of emotion and fear. I feel like I should be released from my calling and feel guilty for that.
* Porn & masturbation - better & worse over the years, Leah's been super patient
	* This one's bad because I just don't feel like I'm hurtin any one, except that it's addictive, and messes up the spirit, and I know I'm hurting Leah.
	* Drop temple recommend.
* Shane Howarth: awesome chat; shared everything in both direction; thank you for helping him.
* Not suicidal, but only because I love my wife and kids, and at the lowest level, value my consciousness & ability to perceive; but I understand now why people choose it, and that's scary too.
* Done with everything except for Netflix, ice cream and Doritos. I' worm out disinterested, and purposeless. Despite the capacity I have to fix it, I am finding it hard to have a desire to do better.
* Father in laws - blessing, really helped to stabilize me, but 
* Part of my thoughts are that, ok - fine, if I have to live, I'll stay alive; but that's almost to much. Anything else just has too much pain in it, and I'm just not sure what to do from here. Some ideas:
	* Started more of a thematic approach - this has helped a lot; I'm deeply interested in understanding some things more.
	* Coming up with more creative ways to solve my struggles.
	* Not making long term decisions when I'm in a bad state.
		

DETAILS:

After my fall apart Friday night, I spent Monday and Tuesday putting together notes on why I don't believe in the church any more, and it was terrifying. At it's simplest level, I had no belief system, and no way to come back to the one I had before. If God and the spirit were completely absent, there's no way to make progress in any direction. It's the exact definition of being dammed.  I can easily believe that hell consists of simply a place with no progression.

I have a significant amount of dred that this fall apart is going to come back. I'm trying some new meds, and so far it's been pretty bumpy, it just makes me tired, and dizzy, and like I"m going to barf; so maybe this will help. My father in law is very effective with the priesthood and gave me a blessing for a few things, but the most powerful part was to remember feeling the spirit, so I have a good portion of my testimony back too.

This feels funny telling a biship, but I feel totally burned out. I find I don't want to do anything but go to work and disappear in the coding. I'm hoping the meds will balance me out a little, but it's going to take time. I'm really frustrated with my calling. I know I feel like I have the capacity, creatigy and intelligence needed to make it great, but I feel only anxiety right now. I don't want to come to church because I"m thinking about teachers not showing, up, and it's never happened!  Every one of our teachers are amazing, but this doesn't seem to make a difference; I feel like I should be released. I don't know if I'm willing to keep trying, I jus don't know what to do with the anxieyt.

I've struggled with porn and masturbation for a long time; I just didn't think I was hurting any one, including Leah - with leah's patience and various bishops over the years, I had more then once where I thought I was past it. I suppose with the pressure of chaos in my life I've messed up again.

I don't think I should have this.
(temple recommend - drop off)
Both Leah and I would like me to go back, but going now feels like it would be wrong due to my lack of worthiness, and it feels just plain disrespectful with what is going on my head., I"m just not in a place where it feels appropriate to go.

On thursday, just as I was feeling crappy - Shane Howarth sent me a text - He has this pretty incredible connection to the spirit; he's done it multiple times. We care about and respect each other; enough to a point I was able to dump on him my experience, then he told me his - thank you for taking care of him.

 I'm kinda done with everything except Netflix, ice cream and Doritos. I'm worn out, disinterested, and a bit purposeless; whats worse, at the moment, I don't want to fix it. Like I said, I'm worried this weirdness is going to come back, I feel it eating at me. Suicide still hasn't been an option, as I care about my wife and kids to much, have close relationships, and at the lowest level, I love my conciousness, and ability to perceive.

That's the summary.
