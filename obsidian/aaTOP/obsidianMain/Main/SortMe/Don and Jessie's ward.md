# Don and Jessie's ward

Dont let what u don't know trump what u do. Not knowing is part of growth and a core rqson why we are here. God will reveal in his own time. We do know what we do know for sure.

Mindful of blessings ALL the time. Gratitude of guy about to leave ward.

God gave us families to he'll us be want we wants us to be.
