# Empower - moderately cheap way to get microsoft stuff.

 Aaron,

My name is Shannon Stubbs, and I work for the US Partner Team at Microsoft®. My job is to help software development companies like yours find the right information and support, and I wanted to get in touch to tell you about an initiative called [Empower for ISVs](http://www.empowerforisv.com/?WT.mc_id=Empower_InMail_Text).

Empower is designed to give ISVs a helping hand in their development. For just U.S. $375 per year, you get an MSDN Premium subscription plus all the software you need to run your business, including Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, the Microsoft Office 2007 suites, Microsoft Office SharePoint® Server 2007, Microsoft SQL Server® 2008, Windows Server® 2008, and Windows Vista®.

Not only that, but your membership also includes 10-hours of telephone-based consulting with our Technical Advisory Services team. You can use this time however you like, whether you need development advice, best-practice recommendations, code samples, or design reviews.

To sign up or learn more, call us at: (866) 613-9198 or email me at .
