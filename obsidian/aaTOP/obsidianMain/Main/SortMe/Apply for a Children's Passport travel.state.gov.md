### 2\. Evidence of Parental Relationship

You must submit evidence that lists you as the parent of the minor applying for a passport.  Some documents, like a U.S. birth certificate, provide both evidence of citizenship and evidence of parental relationship.  If you’re submitting one or more of the documents below as evidence of U.S. citizenship too, you must submit a certified copy.  Photocopies are acceptable only if used as evidence of parental relationship, not citizenship evidence.  Examples of documents that may be used as evidence of parental relationship are:

* U.S. birth certificate

* Foreign birth certificate
* Adoption decree

* Valid Driver’s License (plus a second ID if issued in a different state than where you apply)

* Current, undamaged U.S. Passport (if issued less than 15 years ago)

### 4\. Parental Consent

Minors under age 16 cannot apply for a passport by themselves.

If the minor only has one parent/guardian, evidence of sole authority to apply for the minor must be submitted with the application in the form of a:

* U.S. or foreign **birth certificate**, **Consular Report of Birth Abroad, or adoption decree**, listing **only** the applying parent

* **Court order granting sole legal custody to the applying parent** (unless child’s travel is restricted by that order)
* **Court order specifically permitting applying parent’s travel with the child**
* **Judicial declaration** of incompetence of the non-applying parent
* **Death certificate** of the non-applying parent

[More](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/passports/under-16.html#)

### 5\. Passport Photo

You must provide one passport photograph. The photo must be:

* In color
