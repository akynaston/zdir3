Naman is healed.

Before we get started, I wanted to say really quick - Church should be a place that you are happy that you look forward to being here - I want this class to be fun for you. If there is something that you'd like to do while we're in this class, let me know, and we'll see what we can do  ok?

If you try to be reverent and listen, we'll have a fun lesson, feel the spirit testify of truth, and do something fun ok?

Write this on board then sit down
ZRXAHIGSQEI YROGUKRN HMALNIDTSA IING TNHZEI AKIHRL

Will you guys please do the instructions on the board?
(stare and wait)
Why isn't any one doing the instructions?
Ah - some times when you need to do something, it's hard to know what to do, or you need instructions.

I need a volunteer.

Erase every other letter starting with the Z.

Now can you follow instructions?  Yes!  Why can you read them now?

How many of you have been really sick before? 
What does it feel like?
What did you have to do to get it fixed?

You guy ever heard of a disease named Leprosy? It's a bad skin disease that can really mess up your body. Let me show you some pics

(SHOW LEPROSY PICS)

There is a guy named Naman in 2 Kings in the bible that was a commander of a large army.
What do you imagine a commander looks like?
Maybe confident? Maybe a little bit older? May be afull uniform with all kinds of awareds all over the place?

Naman he had leprosy.

2Kings chapter 5
**1** Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.

So this great commander had this horrible skin disease.  It's probably hard to be a commander or do anything really when you have a disease like this. Nama's wife had a maid that new about a prophet that could heal his leporsy!

**2** And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman’s wife.
**3** And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.

So Naman sends a letter to the king.  When the king gets the letter, he feels really overwhelmned, and rents his clothes - Interesting practice to rip your clothes - But Elisha, the profphet saw this happening, and said, let Naman come see me, and we'll fix him.
    **7** And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.

The King is overwhelemed - doesn't a king of a lot of power? Why did he react this way to the letter?

Well Naman packs up his stuff, and goes:

==**5** And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.==

I'm not sure how much a talent was; but since he only brought 10 of them, I have to guess that it was a very large sum of money - six thousand pices of gold also sounds like a lot of money.

Why do you think Namain brought so much money with him?
(to pay for his healing).

Naman makes the journey to the prophet - hes so happy, he can get healed, and feel better, and not have to have leprosy any more.   Nama get to the prophit and shos all of his great money, and asks to be healed.  Eliahsia sais no.  

Why didn't Elisha take his stuff? Isn't money kinda nice to have?

 When Naman gets there though, a messanger comes out and tells him to wash him self in the river Jordon 7 times.

What do you think Naman does?

He was mad!  First of all, he was a commander and should have had Elisha come out and meet him; but he got a messanger! Then second, there were lots of other major rivers, and he thought why can't I go to one of these beter places and wash?  Isn't that funny? He was told how to heal his horrible disease, and he just got mad!!

IN fact, listen to vs 11

==**11** But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.==

So Nama was expecting that the prophet himself would come over, make a huge deal out of curing Naman.  While namin was a great commander, it sound slike hwas just a little bit prideful.

(if need more time add story about geahiz)

Some of the serviates of elisha were by him, and they said this: 

==**13** And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?==

They're pretyt much saying - i you were told to do something great, you would have done it! but you were told to do something simple, and you didnt.

Naman pretty much looses it - he starts aying he won't worship any more, and gets all upset. The servants tell him he has nothing to lose to go try it, and After some grumbling, Naman finally does it, and is clean.  Isn't that funny, that it took him so long to do something so simple?  

Are there some commands in the church that are easy to follow? Maybe going to church isn't that bad - Maybe not smoking or drinking? Some commandments are easy to follow and some are a bit more difficult. I think some commandments are built to get us into the habit of doing the right thing as often as possible.

Isn't it funny that it took so much work for Naman to get healed?

Lets make sure that we're never too privdeful to follow what the prphet has asked us to do.

Let me read you a story.
President David O. McKay was in Berlin, Germany, in 1952 when he received a message from one of the members of the Church in that mission—a sister whose husband and eldest son had both been killed. She had been driven from her home, and because of exposure and lack of nutrition she finally became paralyzed and had been confined to her bed for five years. She expressed the desire that her two little children—a boy and a girl about ten and twelve years of age—be sent over to meet the President of the Church. This good sister said, “I know if I send my children to shake hands with President McKay, and then they come home and take my hand—if I can hold their little hands in mine I know that I shall get better.”
Arrangements were made for them to take the trip. President McKay said, “When that little girl and boy came along, I went to them and shook their hands, and said, ‘Will you take this handkerchief to your mother with my blessing?’ I later learned that after I had shaken hands with them, they would not shake hands with anyone else, for they did not want to touch anyone with their hands until they got back to their mother.”
The mission president’s wife later reported, “Immediately after the children came home, her feet and toes began to get feeling in them, and this feeling slowly moved up into her legs. And now she gets out of bed alone and seats herself on a chair, and then, with her feet and the chair, works all the way around to the kitchen sink, where she has the children bring her the dishes to wash, and other things, and is very thankful that she is able to help now.” (Adapted from _Cherished Experiences from the Writings of President David O. McKay,_ comp. Clare Middlemiss, rev. ed. \[1976\], pp. 142–44.)

what an amazing blessing it is that we have so many great leaders and people that love us and want us to succeed.  I"m greatful that the Lord cares about us and helps us to get better in many ways.
