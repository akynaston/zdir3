Lesson - 12/28/2014

Prayer
ONe of the main goals of the church is to biuld the Kingdom of God and establish Zion, I missed last week, so don't know how far yo ugot in the lesson - but I wanted to mentions omething - what is a kingdom? I think of a massiv ecastle with a hughe wall and maybe a moat - tall towers and flags, crenelated walls ready for a battle. I imagine solidarity or permannce.  I always thought that living in a castle with a modern furnace, a bathroom, referigerator and freezer would be cool to live in.  Maybe some wifi wouldnt hurt. they seem so solid.  When I think of building a kingdom, I think of building this castle, something of deep strength, something with a clear focus and purpose.

OK - what does Zion mean?  to help answer htis quetsion, have any of you ever had those moments where you were with your family and everything was just right? not only was there a complete lack of fighint, but people seemed to generally care about each other?  The Zion describes this perfect scenaroi where a group of people can live together with one heart and mind; where any of you would drop what you are doing to help some one else.

So we cna see that a huge elements in budling the kingdome of god and establishing zion is building up those around us. Finding everyone that we can and giving them everything that we have.  I think we forget that in the church we are sitting on a gold mine.  We have had something for most of our lives that many people have no idea where to find, or to even be bale to recognize it when it was presented to them.

ONe of the things that God does that I am fascinated with is how much he loves us.  Even when we mess up over and over again.  Not only that, but o realize that every last person you see or don't see is loved of God.

Luke 15 has some of Jesus's parables. These ones focused on recovering what was lost. 

IN the beginning, many peple are gathering around Jesus, the Pharisies there noticed that Jeuss was surrounding himself with all of these sinners, these people tha twerne't living up to their standards.  I loved Jesus's response.  lets read  Luke 15, 4 to 7.

4 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one ofthem, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and goafter that which is lost, until he find it?
5 And when he hath found _it,_ he layeth _it_ on his shoulders,rejoicing.
6 And when he cometh home, he calleth together _his_ friends andneighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have foundmy sheep which was lost.
7 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over onesinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine justpersons, which need no repentance.

he was saying - Hello people - bringing those that are lost back to the Gospel is my point for being here!!  I love that he teaches in parables - his teachings are immediately made more accessible, yet more deep at the same time.  We can understand what he is saying, yet find deeper meaning.

Let me ask a question, growing up have any of you ever lost your favorite toy?
I had a magnet that was strong enough to lift 150 pounds, and I loved it  I played with it for hours.  I've always loved how cool magnetisim is and how it seems to work without any apparent power.

\- Have any of you ever lost your wallet?
\- This idea of loosing things is something I thinkw e're all well aquantd with.  We know loss of every kind. some things can be found again.  One of the most difficult things to loose and find again is People. How many of you have eve rhada  big fight with a brother or sister, or mom and dad?  Something is lost isn't it?

When you get married and have kids, you'll realize that these people are everything to you.  You'll find that loosing them either physicially, emotionally or spitirutally is deeply painful.  You will ahve days that you fight with your wife.  It's those times that you realize how recovering that lost portion of your relationship is the most important thing to you.

Few times I've lost my wallet.  Inf act, I was on a bisuness trip once in California, and I ate lunch at a place called 'the hole in the wall' - it was quite good, but I had left my  wallet on the counter.  IN a place that is so busy like thiat, it is very rare if ever that you'd see your stuff.  I never got hta wallet back. I had just lucke dout that I had cash and a passport with me, so i wa sble to get back home without too much trouble.

In LUke 15, there ar equite a few examples of this loss and recovery. 
Luke 15: 8 to 10 -

11 - 32 - the rest of it - ost sun . .
