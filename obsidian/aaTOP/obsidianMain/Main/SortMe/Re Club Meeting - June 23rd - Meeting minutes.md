# Re: Club Meeting - June 23rd - Meeting minutes

All,

Todays meeting was great. With three speeches and a vinyl record (yes, vinyl) we had an enjoyable time. (BTW - does any one have Jorge's email address? I'm not sure if I have his address.)

We started off the meeting with Susan as the Toastmaster with a few reminders:
 - The Luau is tonight at 6:30 - please see the attachment.
 - The Toastmasters Leader training is Saturday.

We then had three speeches by Craig, Jorge and Aaron.

Craig convinced us that after the ToastMasters meeting, we were going to go to buy Ferrari's after ToastMasters. He explained to us what the Twinkie defense was, then proved it by giving us all Twinkies :-) (long story short: I can't be convicted for forgetting what happened on the 23rd, Craig Twinkied me). BTW - Ferrari of SLC is only 30 minutes away from Lehi. While you are there, ask them if they have any coupons :-) I'm hoping for a BOGO.

Jorge then gave his speech regarding the setting of goals, and talked to us regarding the goals of a man who wanted to be a millionaire by 30, and a billionaire by 50.  He then found setting smaller goals as a stepping stone was a good idea.

Aaron then gave his speech pushing the idea that you are in the driver seat of your own life, or should be, and how to get there. It was even 87% memorized! :-)

We then had some table topics regarding some Journey songs.  It was fun to see an actual record again. It still is the best way to listen to music, but oh, so impractical :-) I have 6,398 songs on my Google account, stream-able to my phone; anyone want to figure out how many vinyl records that is? Can you imagine packing them around??

We had some great evaluations to the speeches - thanks for your work guys! Kevin, Merrie and Leslie did a great job. I sure appreciate this section in our meeting as we can become better. Leslie, thank you, I'll be sure to avoid ending future speeches with the closing phrase "Thats it!" just before rushing to my seat.

Attendees:
Craig, Janette (visitor), Jesse, Mary Hosford, Robert, Jorge, Susan, Reggie, Joe, Kevin, Neeta, Dlayne, Long Luvit (visitor), Michael, Leslie, Aaron.

As always, don't forget to complain if I missed your name in the attendees list :-)
