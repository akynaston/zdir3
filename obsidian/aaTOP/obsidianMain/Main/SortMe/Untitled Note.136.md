Today we are going to talk about the most important topic in the whole gospel of Jesus Christ. Do any of you know what is so important?  The atonement of Jesus Christ.  What is an atonement?

IN the scritupre sthere is a story.  There was a bunch of poeple making fun of members of the church - they were fighing, and pointing and laughing (have you ever been laughed at?) not fun! - Finally a guy named Alma went to king Mosiah to ask for some help.  (do you guys know what  king looks like?). Mosiah wrote down some new laws - he said that no one can make fun of churg members any more - that htey need to be nice and work together.  Guess what?  it worked!  Everyone in the land became so happy and loving to each other that they were happy for a long time - they leved and worked and were kind to each other.

Gues what though? After a while, some people started to get really selfhis and star to say bad things. Mosiah had some sons that didn't believe in God and started to make bad choices. Well Alma also had a son named alma the younger, and he was friends with the sons of Mosiah.  They started going around the city making fun of people again. Is this a good choice or bad choice?  Yea, it was a really bad choice.  lets watch a video that shows what they did.

(show video)

In this video, we see that the sons of mosiah did some bad things; the people int he city started prying so that they would be so bad any more.  IN fact, as we saw in the video an  an angel came to them and taught them that they needed to learn and be better. Have any o fyou seen an agnel?  No, I haven't either, but we know they some times come to talk to us if needed.  Do you remember lamen and lemual? When they were fighting an angel once went to talk to them before. Well, Did you know someitmes angels make the earth shake so the people listening know that the angel came from god?

Here is something the angle said:

**Almoa 27: 14** And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath heardthe prayers of his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of God, that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith.

 **15** And now behold, can ye dispute the power of God? For behold, doth not my voice shake the earth? And can ye not also behold me before you? And I am sent from God.

So who sent the angel to alma the younger and the sons of mosiah?  Did they learn their lesson?  Were they so scared that they decided ot make good choices.

When the angel left - Alma the yojnger and hte sons of mosiah were so warn out and amazed that they just fell on the ground (can I see your supprised faces?)(have some one slump in their chair).

After a few days, peole started getingg worried - alma had faninte,d and wasn't getting back up again!  What were they going to do?  They started to fast and pry.  Hve you guys ever fasted before?  What doe sit mena?  is it hard to fast?

Well when they started fasting, alma regained his strength and stood up and told every on that he had made some bad choices, but then repented.  There's a big word - what does repentance mean?

When he repented, he stood up and started teaching them to be good and make good choices.
