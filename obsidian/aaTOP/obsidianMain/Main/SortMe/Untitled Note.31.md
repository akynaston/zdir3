Hi, my name is Andrew Kynaston.  I"m going to talk about how to put on the armor of God. God has given us the ability to defend against the dangerous things of the world. The armor of God is what helps us make good choices, and be safe in times of danger.

In Ephesians 6, vers 13-17 it says:

13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;
15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
 

I love these scriptures, they help me think of God and want to be better every day. I love Heavenly father so much and I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ Amen.
