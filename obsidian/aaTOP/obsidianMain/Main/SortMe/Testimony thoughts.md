# Testimony thoughts

Nearly everyday when I wake up, I have two thoughts. First, I  love the promise if a new day. Second, I DO NOT like to get out of bed.  It's probably a good thing that like all of you I have responsibilities that require leaving the bed every day.

A 7 year old, a boy named Wyatt Shaw has the gun nnes book of records for sleeping longest at 11 days.  Well I'm going for 12.

I love the idea of having a new day ahead of me. The sense of starting over is similar to repentance.
