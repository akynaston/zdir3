Interesting random thoughts:

IN a religous context: why does God value experience so much?
    He obviously sent us here to get it: we have the capacity for great pain and great pleasure, both amazing happiness and deep sadness.

IN a somewhat less religoius context: what qualifies me to define my own purpose in life?
    I like to think I'm an analytical thinker, so have to assume all posibilities when making theroies.  If God doesn't exist, and we're all here just as some cosmic improbability then I feel like I have to ask this quesiton. I appear to be able to decide for msyelf; but i tihnk a partial anser is nothing. Part of this existance seems to require me quallfitying myself to determine what purpose I should make in it. If we're all here for X amount of years, then there seems to be some need to have a purpose; a definition or goal for life; as it's temporary nature seems to require some explicitly defined direction.
