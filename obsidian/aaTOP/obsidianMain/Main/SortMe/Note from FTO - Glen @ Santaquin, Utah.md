# Note from FTO - Glen @ Santaquin, Utah

I am thankful to give a talk today.
I love Jesus. I think being at church is cool.
I love to learn about church and Jesus so I can have a testimony.
Some times it is hard to make the right choices. But I know that when I make the right choices I get close to Jesus.
I love my sisters holly and McKenzie they help me make good choices and get a testuomoy I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen.
