# Untitled Note

Things I'm going to check immediately after I die:

 - See how much of the veil has been lifted.
     It would seem from Life Everlasting book, that it is not entirely lifted, and that some steps have to be taken before it is fully removed. I haven't heard yet any one speaking of remembering the spirit world.
 - See what it is like to feel my hands and face.
 - Try and sing Nearer My God to Thee; see if I sound good, or other people begin singing with me. :-)
