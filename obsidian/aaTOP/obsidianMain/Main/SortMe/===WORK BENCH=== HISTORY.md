Michae4l told me yesterday that we would get something int heir hands and discuss (probaly with jessop's boss) why they chose a driver over an audit solution.

For now, Im in a position where the driver is code complete again, the driver is a null driver with ecmascript that writes out a rollable-withheaders output files. I had to stop, as I'm working on IR25 for BAE - adding EIS placement of users in IDV.

Note: Michael and I decided we'll need to talk to Jessops's boss about the choise of a DTF driver over some supported audit solution as far as getting the perpetrators name.
