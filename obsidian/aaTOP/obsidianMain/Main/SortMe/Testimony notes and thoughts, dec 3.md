# Testimony notes and thoughts, dec 3

I'm amazed at how gods love can be so puvasive and let we still have the capacity to not see it occasionally.  We seem to need to make conscious effort to see it, then when it floods into us, we wonder how we could have missed it.

We know from the scriptures that we are essentially just getting in our own way. We really have been put in a position to truly muat decide for our selves what we want to make of our lives. While it's somewhat silly that there is an infinite number of ways to mess it up, we totally have a loving God that wants us to succeed.

We find ourselves in a position where we constantly need to reset ourselves and return to the lord. As we marinate in our weaknesses, infirmities and challenges, we either become bitter or begin to wait on the lord.

Waiting on the Lord Jeffery R Holand, from the October 2020 conference:

“Well, if this is the case,” you might say, “shouldn’t His love and mercy simply part our personal Red Seas and allow us to walk through our troubles on dry ground? Shouldn’t He send 21st-century seagulls winging in from somewhere to gobble up all of our pesky 21st-century crickets?” The answer to such questions is “Yes, God can provide miracles instantaneously, but sooner or later we learn that the times and seasons of our mortal journey are His and His alone to direct.”

I think what an interesting experience it must be for God to see us going though crazy experiences, knowing we agreed to be here, and having all power to eliminate our pains, and STILL not do it for our own good.

The thought then becomes not do you believe in God, but are you capable of being faithful enough to wait on the Lord?

I love that even all of our senses  seem to exist as a physical manifestation of a parable, to help us turn back to God as often as possible. Having eyes to see and ears to hear. Light and darkness. Being totally covered in darkness, and seeking the light is still something we try to do.

More love and more patience seems to always be to help answer. Standing by and giving love and support to those around us is the key.

Savior asked a lot of questions? To help people find their own answers to require some effort.

I love how God speaks to us so directly and personally, and in a way we understand. The piercing nature of this communication is so profound.
