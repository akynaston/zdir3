# Pack Night thoughts

Pack Night thoughts

My name is Brother Aaron Kynaston I"m one of the 11 year old scout leaders. I wanted to welcome Michael Mecham into our group, and give a quickquick summary of the 11 year old scouts.

\- The 11 year scouts really focuses on the transition from cub scouts to boy scouts. We'll have a few over night campouts through the year, and concentrate on rank advancements, although the boys can start working on merit badges immediately. We've prepared a yearly plan for the wednesday night activites, and the campouts, and we will be having a lot of fun.

Let me just mention a correction, for those of you that have 11 year old boy scout calendar, there has been a change; we did have a cmapout scheduled for this weekend, but didn't realize it was Easter; so that campout will be rescheduled. When we have a new date, we'll update you.

Is Michael here? Michael, if you would come talk to me for a moment afterwards, I would like to give you the schedule, and some information for your parents.
Thank you for your time.
