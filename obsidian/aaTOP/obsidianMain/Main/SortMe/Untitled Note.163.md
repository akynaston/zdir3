# Untitled Note

Grandpa Vanmoos

1 - Aside from an adventurous last week, Grandpa always had a sharp mind around me. Every time he saw me, He pointed his clear eyes at me and paused for about half a second and said Aaron. He knew me. There was something the way he said it that made me stop and pause, and say, Yes . . .Yes I am.  As if Saying my name was an expression of some unmet potential I haven't attained yet, but that I could. I was greatful for having known him.

Grandpa was really fun too - I remember we went to visit him a few times, and he was wearing his nice sound canceling headphones.  WE would always very carefully enter his house, but please forgive my lack of revernce here, but  every time we came into his feild of view, he would jump, and then we'd hear about how we  we scared the crap out of him.  I enjoyed being around him very much.

I had a chance to work on his computer a little. It was fun to see his setup, I could tell there were quite a few people that helped him out on getting something together he could benefit from.  ON a side note, I recommend that you find all of your grandpas and gramas and backup their computer right now.
