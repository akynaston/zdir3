REVIEW EMAIL - Mine vs' mikes - review . .

Jessop,

As you can see from the readme we are ahead of schedule on the Zimbra driver development. This creates some open time as I have previously planned on spending next week working on this driver. I recommend that we include the development of the scripts in our project.  This has several benefits:

 - Reduces your workload.
 - Mitigates the risk of defining an interface between the driver and scripts.
 - TriVir is enabled to deliver a fully tested, end to end driver.
 - The shift in the work is in alignment original budget.
 - TriVir is enabled maintain a fully functional test environment: Future bug fixes and enhancements would be more timely.

**Would you like to proceed as outlined?**

Jessop,

  As you can see from the delivered iterations and the included functionality, we are ahead of schedule on delivering the Zimbra connector.  We had initially planned on spending next week working on the remaining functionality for this connector however, we are now on schedule to have the connector functionally complete at the end of this week.

  Given that we still have an additional week of budget and calendar time allocated to this project, I think it would be worthwhile to have TriVir take on the engineering of the Zimbra scripts as well.  After reviewing the script requirements, I believe that we can complete the scripts next week and consequently deliver a full and integrated solution inside of the original engineering budget for time and money.

  In addition to reducing your personal workload, I think there are several significant advantages to following this plan.  First and most importantly, the remaining risk in the project is primarily the interface between the IDM connector and the Zimbra scripts.  By allowing TriVir to take on the development of the scripts, we will reduce the risk of miscommunication and conflicting expectations.  Secondly performing this engineering work will allow TriVir to setup a full end-to-end development environment including the Zimbra software itself.  This will enable TriVir to provide superior ongoing support as we will be able to track bugs and issues through the connector, the scripts and the application itself.  We will retain this development environment long-term so it will continue to pay dividends well into the future.

  Ultimately because this work fits inside the original budget, we can perform this work and reap all of the above benefits with no impact to Intellink or CSC.  How do you feel about proceeding down this path?
