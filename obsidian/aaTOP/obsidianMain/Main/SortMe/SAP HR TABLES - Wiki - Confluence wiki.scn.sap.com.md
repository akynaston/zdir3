# SAP HR TABLES - Wiki - Confluence [wiki.scn.sap.com]

HR tables

source:_www.henrikfrank.dk_

All personnel administration tables start with PA and the infotype number behind it.
All personnel development/OM tables start with HRP and infotype (e.g. 1000) behind it.
All recruitment tables start with PB and infotype number behind it.

Transaction SE16 (data browser) is also useful.  As mentioned above, the PA infotype tables all begin with PA and are followed by the infotype number e.g. PA0001 for the Org Man infotype.

PA\* - PA infotype tables
PCL\* - HR clusters
PB\* - recruitment tables
PCERT - payroll posting runs

Another useful table is CATSDB for CATS, and PTEX2000 for the CATS transfer table for infotype 2001/2002.
