PREP TIME:
**0** **hours** **10** **mins**
TOTAL TIME:
**0** **hours** **40** **mins**

Ingredients

1 head green cabbage
1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
Kosher salt
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tsp. ground cumin
2 tsp. chili powder
3 c. shredded, cooked chicken
1 1/3 c. red enchilada sauce, divided
2 tbsp. chopped cilantro, plus more for garnish
1 c. shredded monterey jack
1/2 c. shredded cheddar
Sour cream, for drizzling

Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350º. In a large pot, boil 4 cups water. Using tongs, dip each cabbage leaf in water for 30 seconds and place on a paper towel-lined plate to dry.
2. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and bell pepper and season with salt. Cook until soft, 5 minutes, then stir in garlic, cumin and chili powder. Add shredded chicken and 1 cup enchilada sauce and stir until saucy. Turn off heat and stir in cilantro.
3. Place a heaping spoon of chicken mixture into the center of each cabbage leaf. Fold the short sides of the cabbage leaf in first, then roll into a cylinder — like a burrito! Repeat until all chicken mixture is used.
4. Spoon remaining 1/3 cup enchilada sauce over cabbage enchiladas and sprinkle with both cheeses. Bake until melty, about 20 minutes. Garnish with sour cream and more cilantro and serve.
