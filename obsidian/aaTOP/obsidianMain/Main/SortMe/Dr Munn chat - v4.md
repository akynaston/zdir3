# Dr Munn chat - v4

**Just want to adjust meds**

**I'm on**

* Pantropozal
* Fluticasone maintenance inhaler
* Fluoxitine
* Vitamin D3 since I was low
* Cetirizine for allergies most days

**My only goals are to feel less tired, and maybe even change depression meds?** I'm happy to just change one thing at a time. Last time I thought the yestotone wasn't doing anything, but now I'm not so sure. Been on 10 mg of fluoxitine for a while, think it's a low dose, but not sure.
