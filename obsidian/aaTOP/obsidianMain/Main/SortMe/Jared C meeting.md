*  Thank you for your time on this, I feel pretty silly now and like I've just been creating drama.
*  I feel a lot more stable now, and am doing much better. 
* Our finances aren't where I want them and we've had a lot of surprise stuff lately; but both Leah and I are committed to cleaning it up completely. Leah and I have repeatedly found that it is so nice having dedicated money to places where we need to spend; and a clear shared vision on where we want to put our money, and a history of how we've spent.
* Our house is still a mess, and we have a very high amount of chaos - its funny - after my trobules last year I started praying for more spirit: getting my temple recommend back and getting my house clean was a very clear answer; so slowly but shurley.
* Conference was awesome - I think it wa spreisthoodsession where I felt really inspirred to have a plan to avoid temptation and triggers for addiction; it's been so good to chat with Leah and figure things out.
* My weight is still goofed; but I think I have a more healthy vew that it's simply something I want to make better, and not something that I shoudl be depressed about.,

* my faith feels a lot better: I remember being obsessed with the idea that I can't prove God exists; then realized it's sor tof hte wrong question: I realized if I suddenly could prove that he did, it wouldn't change anything: I'd still love my wife, I'd still want to be a good dad, coean my house, and still go to work and church.
	* Being obsesed with the question is really just an excuse to see my convernats as something less than they are.
