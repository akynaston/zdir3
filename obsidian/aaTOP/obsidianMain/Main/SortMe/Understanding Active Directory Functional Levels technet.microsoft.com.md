# Understanding Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Functional Levels

81 out of 87 rated this helpful \- [Rate this topic](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/understanding-active-directory-functional-levels%28v=ws.10%29.aspx#feedback)

Updated: May 28, 2014

Applies To: Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2

Functional levels determine the available Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain or forest capabilities. They also determine which Windows Server operating systems you can run on domain controllers in the domain or forest. However, functional levels do not affect which operating systems you can run on workstations and member servers that are joined to the domain or forest.

When you deploy AD DS, set the domain and forest functional levels to the highest value that your environment can support. This way, you can use as many AD DS features as possible. For example, if you are sure that you will never add domain controllers that run Windows Server 2003 to the domain or forest, select the Windows Server 2008 functional level during the deployment process. However, if you might retain or add domain controllers that run Windows Server 2003, select the Windows Server 2003 functional level.

When you deploy a new forest, you are prompted to set the forest functional level and then set the domain functional level. You cannot set the domain functional level to a value that is lower than the forest functional level. For example, if you set the forest functional level to Windows Server 2008, you can set the domain functional level only to Windows Server 2008. In this case, the Windows 2000 native and Windows Server 2003 domain functional level values are not available. In addition, all domains that you subsequently add to that forest have the Windows Server 2008 domain functional level by default.

You can set the domain functional level to a value that is higher than the forest functional level. For example, if the forest functional level is Windows Server 2003, you can set the domain functional level to Windows Server 2003or higher.

The following sections describe the features that are available at the different functional levels.

## 
[[#|Features that are available at domain functional levels]]

The following table shows the features that are available at each domain functional level.

All the default AD DS features, all the features that are available at the Windows 2000 native domain functional level, and the following features are available:

* The domain management tool, Netdom.exe, which makes it possible for you to rename domain controllers
	
* Logon time stamp updates
	The **lastLogonTimestamp** attribute is updated with the last logon time of the user or computer. This attribute is replicated within the domain.
	
* The ability to set the **userPassword** attribute as the effective password on **inetOrgPerson** and user objects
	
* The ability to redirect Users and Computers containers
	By default, two well-known containers are provided for housing computer and user accounts, namely, cn=Computers,<domain root> and cn=Users,<domain root>. This feature allows the definition of a new, well-known location for these accounts.
	
* The ability for Authorization Manager to store its authorization policies in AD DS
	
* Constrained delegation
	Constrained delegation makes it possible for applications to take advantage of the secure delegation of user credentials by means of Kerberos-based authentication.
	You can restrict delegation to specific destination services only.
	
* Selective authentication
	Selective authentication makes it is possible for you to specify the users and groups from a trusted forest who are allowed to authenticate to resource servers in a trusting forest.

All of the default AD DS features, all of the features from the Windows Server 2003 domain functional level, and the following features are available:

* Distributed File System (DFS) replication support for the Windows Server 2003 System Volume (SYSVOL)
	DFS replication support provides more robust and detailed replication of SYSVOL contents.
	
	| ![[./_resources/Understanding_Active_Directory_Functional_Levels_technet.microsoft.com.resources/clear.gif]]Note |
	| --- |
	| Beginning with Windows Server 2012 R2, File Replication Service (FRS) is deprecated. A new domain that is created on a domain controller that runs at least Windows Server 2012 R2 must be set to the Windows Server 2008 domain functional level or higher. |
	
* Domain-based DFS namespaces running in Windows Server 2008 Mode, which includes support for access-based enumeration and increased scalability. Domain-based namespaces in Windows Server 2008 mode also require the forest to use the Windows Server 2003 forest functional level. For more information, see [Choose a Namespace Type](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=180400) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=180400).
	
* Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 128 and AES 256) support for the Kerberos protocol. In order for TGTs to be issued using AES, the domain functional level must be Windows Server 2008 or higher and the domain password needs to be changed.
	
	| ![[./_resources/Understanding_Active_Directory_Functional_Levels_technet.microsoft.com.resources/clear.gif]]Note |
	| --- |
	| Authentication errors may occur on a domain controller after the domain functional level is raised to Windows Server 2008 or higher if the domain controller has already replicated the DFL change but has not yet refreshed the krbtgt password. In this case, a restart of the KDC service on the domain controller will trigger an in-memory refresh of the new krbtgt password and resolve related authentication errors. |

All default Active Directory features, all features from the Windows Server 2008 domain functional level, plus the following features:

* Authentication mechanism assurance, which packages information about the type of logon method (smart card or user name/password) that is used to authenticate domain users inside each user’s Kerberos token. When this feature is enabled in a network environment that has deployed a federated identity management infrastructure, such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), the information in the token can then be extracted whenever a user attempts to access any claims-aware application that has been developed to determine authorization based on a user’s logon method.
	
* Automatic SPN management for services running on a particular computer under the context of a Managed Service Account when the name or DNS host name of the machine account changes.

[[#|Guidelines for raising domain and forest functional levels]]

The following guidelines apply to raising the domain or forest functional levels:

* You must be a member of the Domain Admins group to raise the domain functional level.
	

* You must be a member of the Enterprise Admins group to raise the forest functional level.
	
* You can raise the domain functional level on the primary domain controller (PDC) emulator operations master only. The AD DS administrative tools that you use to raise the domain functional level (the Active Directory Domains and Trusts snap-in and the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in) automatically target the PDC emulator when you raise the domain functional level.
	
* You can raise the forest functional level on the schema operations master only. Active Directory Domains and Trusts automatically targets the schema operations master when you raise the forest functional level.
	
* You can raise the functional level of a domain only if all domain controllers in the domain run the version or versions of Windows Server that the new functional level supports.
	
* You can raise the functional level of a forest only if all domain controllers in the forest run the version or versions of Windows Server that the new functional level supports.
	
* You cannot set the domain functional level to a value that is lower than the forest functional level, but you can set it to a value that is equal to or higher than the forest functional level.
	
* With versions of Windows Server that are earlier than Windows Server 2008 R2, you cannot roll back or lower a functional level under any circumstances. If you have to revert to a lower functional level with a version of Windows Server that is earlier than Windows Server 2008 R2, you must rebuild the domain or forest or restore it from a backup copy.
	
* After you set the domain functional level, you cannot roll back or lower the domain functional level except in the cases listed in the following table. The domain functional level can be lowered only by using Windows PowerShell. For more information, see [Set-ADDomainMode](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee617230.aspx).
	
	| Current domain functional level | Current forest functional level | Rollback options |
	| --- | --- | --- |

	| Windows Server 2008 R2 | Windows Server 2008 | Windows Server 2008 |
	| Windows Server 2008 or lower | Windows Server 2008 or lower | None |
	
* After you set the forest functional level, you cannot roll back or lower the forest functional level except in the cases listed in the following table. The forest functional level can be lowered only by using Windows PowerShell. For more information, see [Set-ADForestMode](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee617220.aspx).

### What is removed from the different versions?

Hey!!

I like the article to see whats new and added. But I would like to see what will stop working when you demote a DC, and raise DFL/FFL. Like support for different protocols, etc that no longer works.
This would be great to see, so you can prepare your enterprise for when you try to get rid of old Server 2003 Domain Controllers, or raise the DFL/FFL to a higher level.

Thanks

Daniel

### Win Server 2k8 DC Limitation to Win Server 2012

Hello,
I am new to Server management. I am currently looking for compatibility for Win Server 2012 with our existing Domain which is on Windows Server 2008 R2.
If someone could help me on this query or suggest me a document which shows the same, it would be great !!
Regards,
Karan

### Personal Virtual Desktops

Personal Virtual Desktops - It says "your AD DS schema must be extended for Windows Server 2008 R2", but this article (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd941616%28WS.10%29.aspx) says " your schema for Active Directory forest must be at least Windows Server 2008". So which one is true? R2 functional level is a requirement, or not?

### Forest Functional Levels

There is no "Windows 2000 Native" Forest Functional Level, it is just "Windows 2000" functional level.
(This was a question on the old MCSE exam, and if you answered "Native" it was marked wrong!)

After enabling the Recycle Bin, every non-GC DC will act like an Infrastructure Master and IM FSMO placement no longer matters.
