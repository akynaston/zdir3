# Dad Stories

I have two stories.

AirChair
There is very little on this planet that is funner than my dad crashing on an AirChair.  If you dont know what that is, imagine this kneeboard shaped device with a seat belt equiped chair bolted on the top, and a hughe metal death anchor bolted on the botom, then attaching your self to the thing then being drug behind a boat.  

I didn't mention yet that the big metal thing on the bottom also has a fin. If done right, some one can sit strapped into this thing and essentially float above the water as you are pulled behind a boat, but it doesn't always work that way.  Apparently, the the way you hold the tow rope directly affects how high out of the water you go. You can search for air chair on youtube and find some people riding this contrapion - and you can see that you can shoot out of the water dozesn of feet in the air, back flip, side flip, then lad in the water again.  IN fact, one dude even bounces back down into the water, and goes back into the air for another flip.

As amazing as my Dad is, I think it would be approriate to categorize him as an Air Chair novice. My Dad can shoot out of the water in to the air just like the youtube videos just fine, but when he comes back down, he likes to land on his face.  Now, if he were landing on a pile of stationary marshmellows, this wouldn't be so bad.  But his face is hitting wather, which is also going about 26 knots, or 30 miles per hour. Despite his profesionall execution of this face break maneuver and the incredible stopping power of his face,  the hughe metal undercarriage of the airchiar very thoroughly obeys the laws of gravity, and smashes my poor dad into the water at literally break neck speeds, and oh what a splash it makes. I swear I remember some crashes that sprayed my face with water, while I was at the safe end of the tow rope sitting in the boat. It was quite the experience, I have to assume that Dad still has lake water in his brain due to this experience.

My Dad always has made me laugh. more importantly, he's taught me to deeply appreciate the humor in all of life; to sense an energy of happiness from every situation.

While I really enjoyed the airchair, probably the most memorable time I've had with my Dad is coming to learn and to love to memorize something. From talks to all sorts, to a rubix cube, my Dad wanted me to store stuff in my head like it was a harddrive.

I remember sitting for a long time on the porch swiing outside our house, going through that dang rubix cube solution book tryhing to get it right.  I remember Dad would repeatedly remind me to, "NO, don't turn it; we have to hold it the same way as we do the moves", or just exactly what F+ L- and B2 meant in the instruction book.  I can still solve a rubix cube to this day, and can memorize all kinds of things because of this,a nd I"m greatful for it. back in the day, we a nintendogame called river city ransom until we worked up our guy to the maximum, then wrote down and memorized the 33 character password., and I still have it memorized, and I think a few members in our family have the same password memorized

These memorization sessions for me, branched out into a strong desire for self awareness, and to give me a deep love of not only just storing stuff in my head, but to have real understanding of the world around me.  

I'm grateful for this crazy guy we call Dad - Happy Birthday Dad.
