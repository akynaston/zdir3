Young men presidency

Boys leadership thoughts
 - Need to let boys run everything
      - need to ensure they know what their responsabilities are . I don't know what they are; can we write some down?

 - Need boys to know they feel cared about.

 - Need a friend . . .if not same age - us? Is it appropriate to give them our phone numbers and tell them it's ok to call? It seems that w'ed be bumping u against potential church violations

 - Need to care about each other . . I remember I really loved activites that weren't even necdessarily church related; but were somthing fun that forced me to get to know others i my group - if e could get Caleb and Trevor to go to that, it would solve a few of our issues.
      - even as something as a game night like family fued - chess? Other physcial activites in doors?. .
      - snowball making contetest? Cool talent contets?
