 - Plans?
Very heavy depression lately: I suppose part of it may be due to a lack of faith to some degree. I spend so much time of my life looking at how things work, seeing the nuts and bolts of things; that some times I forget to realize that there's a lot more.

Leah and I have made some crappy decisions financially - She's quite a bit more impulsive than I am; and I am really bad at saying no to my wife.  I had this assumption that she would see and value and want to manage money the same way I do; and I can see that was comptely invalid. I also found that I consdier her a part of my self: so any time she does something that seems super wacky to me; it's hard for me to process, and I feel guilted into giving her what she wants.  we're slowly recovering from this I think; but it's created a somewhat olverwheming weight of debt. We've moved to zero dollar budget and that's really helped; and have a goal for savings; but it's just irritating that it is sow slow. - Then last Friday, our water heater went out; and we need 1000 dollars of rack and pinion fixing on our van!!  It's just overwelming that i can't get ahead.

 - Very senstiive to not getting neough sleep.
 - Social anxieity.
