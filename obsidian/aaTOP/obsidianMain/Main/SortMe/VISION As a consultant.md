# VISION: As a consultant

**GOAL: Trivir will succeed because we are the best at what we do.**

(7 Habits)

			**Be Proactive
		**
		
			**Begin with the end in mind**
		
			**Put first things first.**
		
			**Think Win-win**
		
			**Seek first to understand, then to be understood.**
		
			**Synergize**
		
			**Sharpen the saw**
		

			**I will first and formost understand everything I possibly can within the time I'm allowed.**
		
			**Infectious Success**
		
				I want to infect people with a desire to embrace the 7 habits.
			
			**NO BOUNDARIES**
		
				When building a solution, I will always analyze all restrictions I place on my self, whether explicitly or unconciosuly, and ensure I come up with the best solution-match to the issue at hand.
			
			**NO FEAR**
		
				When situations that may set the stage for fear, guilt or remorse, they will be used as triggers for success.
			
				I will no longer feel like a failure, or be consumed with feeling sorry for my self, these will also be used as triggers for success.
			
				My actions will not be driven by fear - they will be driven by a focused desire for TriVir and me to succeed.
			
			**I will require no more wake up situations**
		
				12/23/2008 4:18:54 PM - last week was wake up session
			
				I will constantly refocus and recommit myself daily.
			
				I will refocus, re-wake up on my own cycle when I see it coming.
			
			**I will slow down: Action does not mean progress.**
		
				My goal is NOT to simply complete my work load, it is to successfully and methodically
			
				I will understand the purpose of what I am doing and where I spend my time, putting first things first.
			
				My focus will not be to get to the end of what I'm doing, but to complete it logically and methodically, and fully understand each piece for each item on each action I take.
			
					When I ask a question, I will fully understand the response before continuing.
				
				I communicate what I mean, and mean what I communicate.
			
			**I am here because I care about TriVir and its success.**
		
				Each of my actions will be executed only after considering those I work with and those I work for.
			
				When I spend time on something, training, time off, billing - it will be because TriVir will either not be affected or it will improve in some way.
			
			**My focus will not be a regular periodic activity, it will be the only thing I do.**
		
				I don't have to remind my self to focus, because my whole thought process has changed - I'm not coding, or updating a test, or checking something in, I am creating success.
			
				I will avoid falling into the auto pilot mentality.
			
				I will be conscious at all times.
			
					I will take 5 to 10 minutes a day in typing tutor for the following reasons:
				
						Typing is the core of how I interact with the computer every day. If my typing is deliberate focused and in line, my thoughts will be too.
					
						Get rid of the says vs sais issue.
					
						Begin my day with clearing my mind and having some time to set my focus before I do anything.
					
			**I will begin with the end in mind.**
		
				I will deliver a BMW when they are expecting a KIA.
			
				This does not mean more hours spent; it means every hour spent will be in finishing tasks with precision and organization, and constant attention to detail.
			
			**I will listen and understand first.**
		
				All communication will take place only after I believe I have a full understanding of the subject of discussion.
			
				All communication will be single minded.
			
				I will re-read all emails I send out (including non-work emails) and ensure they portray my exact thoughts, nothing more or nothing less.
