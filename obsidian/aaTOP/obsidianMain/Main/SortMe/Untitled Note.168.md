Talk on Arronic priesthood For Mosida

 - Wanna talk: I love Power - electricity to to Wolverines set of adamantium claws, supermans ability to shoot lasers out of his eyes, 
      - I like lasers too but that conversation will have to come another night.
 - I love the power in new technology - Even my phone has a quad core processor - who would of thought 10 or even 5 years go that we sould have multil processor cell phones People would have just laughed at you. With 2 gig of ram and 80 GIG of flash memory, built in GPS and accelermaoter it realy is a full computer in it sown right. I can even connect to and interact with it as if it were a Linux server which very cool.
 - Before I get too far though, does any one have a good sciencey defintion of what power is?  The defintion taought to me was the ability to do work.
 - I have something with me that I really enjoy.  It's called a switch 10.
      - charges off of USB, and then powers any USB device.
      - The fact that it is possible to take somethin glike electricity and hold it in a a little place facsinates me.
 - Another example of power, is that of a super hero. - Green lantern. Love watching wolverine heal really fast, or beat up the bad guys before they new what happened
      - Or spidermans ability to shoot webs from his hands and swing all over a city.  That's cool.
 - As a little kid - imagine impressions on my mind - some one told me I would get the arronic priesthood and it was the power of god.
      - im y 5 year old little brain I started to make some plans.
     - I was convinced that when I became adeacon I would be ablte to leap buildings ina single bound and turn into the hulk whenever I wanted to.  
     - This wasn't quite right.
 - What is the priesthood? (twice) We'v eheard a lot of defintioins, but the one I like the best is (twice) "the authroty to serve others using Gods power" 
     - That should make us pause for a moment.  The authroty to serve uthers with Gods Power - what an  amazing amount of love and trust that God must have for us.
 - When the idea sanek in that even though I probably wound't ber running as fast as superman or lifting up tanks with my bare hands, Gods Power is real and with us right now.
      God will give us any amount of strength or power that we need to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.

More specifically, can any one tell me what the arronic presthood is ant he purpse of it?

The church handbok says that the:
The Aaronic Priesthood holds “the key of the ministering of angels and the preparatory gospel; which gospel is the gospel of repentance and of baptism, and the remission of sins” ([D&C 84:26–27](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.26-27?lang=eng#25); see also [D&C 13:1](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/13.1?lang=eng#0); [107:20](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.20?lang=eng#19)). The Aaronic Priesthood also “has power in administering outward ordinances” ([D&C 107:14](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.14?lang=eng#13)).
Through its keysand powers, it helps us to live better lives, to be clean in our thoughtsand actions, to show more love and respect to our parents and [family](http://www.mormon.org/values/family)members, to keep our bodies free from drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and otherharmful substances. This power strengthens a young man and helps himto keep his mind and body clean and to have the courage to say no.

When I heard things like this, it reminded me that my ability to lift a tank, shoot ice or fire from my hands is all quite cool, but has no real meaning or importants.

Let me read a quick section from a talk from Robert B Harbertson: <https://www.lds.org/new-era/1990/05/the-aaronic-priesthood-whats-so-great-about-it?lang=eng>

**\[The Aaronic Priesthood\] helps young men to be more aware of the way they should treat youngladies when they have the opportunity to date them. A young womanshould have no fear in dating a young man who bears and honors theAaronic Priesthood. She should know that he would never take her into anundesirable environment or situation. He would never expose her to pornographic videos or movies. She should be at ease knowing he wouldprotect her honor and virtue at any cost. Why? Because he has had theAaronic Priesthood conferred upon him; he is a son of God; he has theright to the ministering of angels; and through the power of the HolyGhost, he will be strengthened, warned, and protected from these evils if he is striving to be worthy.**

 - closely linked holy ghost and arronic priesthood.
It's cool to see how closely tied the Aronic priesthood and the Holy ghost are. Seen this way, it is as if the Holy ghost helps us to make correct decisions, where the priesthood allows us to make these correct decisions with Gods Power and authority. In our goofy world today this is an ecouragoing thought

I promise you that you will have situations in your life where you will be presented with multiple options and your worthyness to hold the priesthood you now bear will be a key factor in your success.You have an immense power that makes Wolverine look like a kitten. Be worhty of Gods Power that you have.  Know that there are people that watch you and come to learn about the gospel because of you. I want to tell you that you are surrounded by leaders and friends that care about you have a have a deep desire to see you not only succeed, but to do so happily. These leaders that you work with want to give you everything you need to make good decisions.  Please reach out if you need something we are here to see you succeed.

I"m grateful for the priesthood, now especially as a father. You will quickly find when you look at your own children you will do anything for them. Knowing that the power and authority of God has already been given to you is quite humbling and very empowering. Be greatful for the presthood you hold and learn about it as much as you can.

I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen.

DETAILS:
I would like to talk to you guys about something that I absooutly love. I love Power.  All kinds of power - Everything form electiricy to Superman's ability to shoot lasers out of his eyes.  I like lasers too but we'll have to talk about that another nite. Growing up as a kid, I've alwasy been fascinated by this idea of Power.  As I mentioned, electricity is one of the powers that I've really liked (show swith 10).

IN my hands, I have something called a Switch 10. It is simply a fancy battery that charges my phone, and has a cool built in flashlight. It's pretty simple, and that's realy all that it does.  But it fascniates me to no end.  The fact that I can take something as volitle as electircity and store it in a safe battery is very cool.  With this battery, i can charge anything that charges off of USB and I love it.

Antoher kind of power, that I've been fascinated with is the ability of a super hero. I remember after I saw the Green lantern for the first time, I wore a ring on my finger for the next 6 months completle convienced I could do anything while wearing it. I love watching wolverine heal really fast, or beat up some bad guys before they knew what was happening. Spidermans abilty to shoot webs and swing all over the place is really cool.

You can imagein as a little kid, I had all of these impressions in my mind when some one told me about something called the priesthood.  I remember people telling me that the priesthood is power.  I immediately thought that when I became decon, I could leap tall buildings ina single bound or turn into the hulk whenver I wanted to. This wasn't quite right.  Can any on tell me what the preisthood is?

The definition that seems the best to me is  "The authority to serve others using Gods Power". Let me say that again: "The authority to serve others using Gods Power". When this finally sank in, I realized even though I would like to be able to run as fast as super man, or pick up a tank with my bare hands like the hulk can, Gods power is real and with us now.  God will give us any amount of strength or power that we need to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.
