OA Expense reports

All,
Expense reports are now working in OA. Please enter your expense reports for March into OA by Monday March 30th.
Here is a brief set of instructions for how to enter an expense report for internal expenses:
\- Go to Expenses -> Create -> Expense report
\- Enter the Name, Description, and optionally Notes for your expense report and click "Create expense report" (leave the Date field as the current date and leave the NetSuite ID empty)
\- You will be taken to the New receipt page. You can use this page to enter your receipts but I prefer to click on "Expense Grid" and use that page to enter my receipts.
\- Enter each of your expenses. For each expense you will need to enter an Expense item, Client:Project (this should be TriVir:Internal for expenses not related to a project, e.g. monthly office expenses), Date, Quantity (generally 1), Price, optionally Description and Notes, Billable (un-check this for expenses that will not be billed to a customer), and possibly Missing receipt (if you have lost your receipt).
\- Save your expense report
\- Click the "Submit/Approve" link below the tabs at the top of the page
\- Optionally enter any Notes on the "Submit/Approve" page
\- Click Submit
\- Click the "Expense Report" link above the Approval History, this should display an HTML version of your expense report
\- Click the "PDF version" link then click the "Expense report" link to download a PDF copy of your expense report
\- Submit the PDF and your receipts to Julie (either in paper or electronic form) as you have been with NetSuite
Let me know if you have any questions about this process.
Thanks,
\--Huston
