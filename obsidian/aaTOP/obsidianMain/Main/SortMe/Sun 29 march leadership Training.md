# Sun 29 march leadership Training

Training
Quorum leaders: increasing involvement.
Involved with what motivates them.
Let them lead.
Silence is ok, let them be a little uncomfortable.

Have an agenda.
Purpose of byc. Coordinate inactive, activities.
  Return and report. How doing, eagle projects.
Bishop  says a little, leaders nothing, boys say lots.
Qurorm presidency meeting.

Knowledge, the how and what
Power, the ability to act
Desire willingness to do

Training for mission, no leadership but you!
Lack for understanding.   The what and how.
Issue: over estimate experience, underestimate ability.

Preparation for meetings
We are just advisors.

Have a leadership activity... something that requires direction from a single mind.
