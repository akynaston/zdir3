THOUGHT FOR JULY 16

 - thinking alot about struggle and pain in general. After a substantial amoutn of thought I decided I don't like either very much.
 - OUr struggles these days dont' involve walking in miles of snow with no shoes, or severe hunger; but are very real
 - TAlked alot about depression in our ward started some great conversations about real issues - gives some perspective. We all have a considerable amount of struggle to deal with.
 - At a time where I was overly frustrated, I was invited to read a talk aby Richard G Scott in 1995 called trust in the lord. he talks about two kinds of real pain: the first is the one we cause ourselves or to each other, the second is just a by product of this state of being. The first of course is solved by real repentence, but the second is what he spends the rest of his talk on. This plus the currant bush talk by hubh B bround made me realize that God - DEEPLY wnats us to be humble. IN a world where even just surviving requires a substantial amount of effort and struggle; God would have us be humble. Pain and struggle is not a sign of an absent God but one that is more involved in our lives and more interested in our successes than we know. 
 - Like I said, I don't like pain and struggle very much, and I'm not about to start praying for more struggles but knowing God is there and is mindful sure fixes my perspective. I'm greatful for this knoweldge, and I say this in the name of Jesus christ amen.
