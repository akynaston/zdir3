Speech intro:

Aaron Kynaston, in his speech, "An Oportunity for a Broken Mind.", He will share with us a recent opportunity that kicked him in the face and was promptly flushed down the toilet. While it was deeply enjoyed, Aaron is still muttering about it. Aaron Kynaston, "An Opportunity for a Broken Mind."

Have you ever been walking along in life, then suddently - BAM!! YOu fullly wake up out of your daily stupor, look around and realize that your brain has completely failed you.

(shake head) hands on hips, wander around stage for a sec  . .

Man, . . do I have a story for you.  Before I get into it though, I need to give some quick context.

I've read maybe a dozen books by a guy named Brandon Sanderson. I've come to realize that he is by far my favorite author. The guy is able to inspire, empower and entertain with simple, yet masterfully constructed words. I've seen a few of his youtube videos where he talks about some core elements of writing and further explains his own desire to write. I hope some day I can write half as good as he can. I recently found that he actually teaches at BYU!  My favorite author is right here in Utah, and in our backyard. Can you believe it? How cool is that?  

Now, let me tell you why this is a problem.

I was going along minding my own business, everything was great in the world.  I was walking next to my beautiful wife in the Provo Mall, next to my kids who were riding those little animal cars that can be rented for a while. Things were just fine. If you have ever read a Pet the cat book, Iw as walking along singing my song. I was looking sharp, with a smile on my face, deoderant carefully applied, and I had even combed my Hair - when I have nice hair, you know I"m having a good day.
(rub hair a bit, and look int a mirror) - (then wink. and shoot guns)

Then I saw something out of the corner of my mind that made my mind slip out of gear.  Have any of you ever been standing next to a desiel in a parking lot that was driving away by a guy that doesn't know how to drive a manual transmission? Do you know how you hear that beautiful disel engine? It sounds like this:

(GRRAGAGGGAGRAR)

Then you can tell they shift into gear because it goes:

(crakrakrakark . . .crarkackrackrakckar), make unsure face with eyebrows, and bend over like I"m looking under the desel.

(say this haltinglinyh, and wth a bad look on your face?)
Then you start to look under the desiel to see how many parts have just fallen on the road.  Remember that sound, it's important to the story.

This is what happened to my brain. Like I mentioned, I was walking along, everything was pieceful and enjoyable until suddently, I saw someone come into view. As I stood there, the next 4 seconds were a little bit tough on my brain.  Let me show you what happened.

"Alright come on brain, I just saw someone, and I swear I know him, who is that??"

(Go to chair and sit down; put on 'Aaron's brain' hat, and turnaround box of "Long Term Memories"). 
"Lets see, I know I've seen that guy somewhere"
(carefully aaline papers)
"OH yea, she was cute", slap self, "stay on task, stay on task, your married
"Oh, I still need to pay that bill"
"HOly Monkies!!" Brandon Sanderson is standing 10 feet from me!!

(crackarkcackcakrk  . . .ckrkakckrkakrakrka), toss carefully stacked papers on the floor.
(TAPE GON FISHING ON FORHEAD)

"Great, thanks a lot brain".

STand really nervous, "say Uh . ." Excuse me, <swallow> are you Brandon sanderonson?  Happily, the Strainger said, Yes, yes I am. My fate was sealed.  With my brain out to lunch, I studdered through a few thoughts that happen to pop into my , I think I said something about being thankful for his work; which, Hopefully didn't come out like I was some crazy stocker dude. After stuttering through a few more useless, unintelligent comments, I shook his hand, and said thank you for your time, and went staggering back to my wife.

When I made it back to my wife, she had a surprised look on her face. She promptly said, I"m surprised you didn't want a picture with him!! 
DUH!!  smack forhead - Remember - good for nothing brain over there is out for the count (hold up gone fishing). I ran back to him, got a picture, and posted it on facebook. Thankfully, he asked me if I wanted an authograph - which I"m so greatful for. He asked me what my name was . .I"m glad I passed that quiz, because he pulls out this thing he calls a name plate, and hands it to me.

Now feeling like I was going to faint, I slowly walkted back to my wife, holding this new found name plate thing that my favorite author had just given me.  What an experience.  I was so irritated with my self, I had so manythings I wanted to say to him to try and express how greatful I am for him showing me how powerful a story can be.

If I could have that opportunity again, I would have looked him in the eyes, and said, At one point, you said in a youtube video, that you write with the intent to inspire people to be better. You wanted to write to give people a clear understanding of the potential nobility in every human being. You have deeply succeeded. With your Characters from Mistborn, of Kelsier and Vin, and then with Kaladin and Dalinar from the Stormlight Archive books; characters who are deeply flawed, yet have that deeply burning soul of solidly good people who are simply awesome, (this time slower) you have succeeded bigtime. I am a better person because of you. Thank you for your work.

I'm so glad that I didn't give him a hug or faint; I was close to doing both, and that would have embarrased both of us. Thank you.
