System Error Codes (8200-8999)

The table in this topic provides a list of [system error codes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms681381(VS.85).aspx) for errors 8200 to 8999. These values are defined in the WinError.h header file. They are returned by the [**GetLastError**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms679360(VS.85).aspx) function when many functions fail. To retrieve the description text for the error in your application, use the [**FormatMessage**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms679351(VS.85).aspx) function with the FORMAT\_MESSAGE\_FROM\_SYSTEM flag.

If you are experiencing difficulty with an application you are installing or running, contact customer support for the software that is displaying the error message. To obtain support for a Microsoft product, go to [http://support.microsoft.com](http://go.microsoft.com/FWLink/?LinkId=83978).
