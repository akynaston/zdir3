Lesson 6/13/2015 -

Show battery - I have a visitor with me today.  One of the things I enjoy about teaching a lession is to bring cool stuff.  I love things that are viciously practical, and this is one of the most.

This is a battery that can jump a car, has two AC power outlets, two DC power outlets, a USB port, it can inflate car and bicycle tires, and even air mattresses.  it charges on standard AC from an extension cord.

As you probably know by now, any excuse that I get to talk about electricity in a lesson, I'll take it.  To me it's a kind of power that I understand and immediately put to use.
When I think of Power this is what I think of. I really like this thing - I believe I can run my laptop on it for at least two 8 hour sesssions before the battery dies.

When I was tought that preisthood is a power, my first thought was that I could bless my phone, and charge the battery.  Of course it doesn't work that way.

As you know, the priesthood is the power and authority of God; its through the priesthood that we can do things that God or the savior might do if they were in our place.

One of the funny things about electricity that bothers me a little is that there are so many ifferent kinds of cabels.  There's been a bunch of times where I'll start t otdrive to work with this battery, but even though I have multiple cables in my car, if I don't have that one special cable fo rmy phone, the whole battery is useless.  I look forward to an invention in power transference that removes this need for special cables or parts.  The chi charging for phones comes close but it's not quite there yet.

While the priesthood doesn't require special cabels or adapters, it does have a particular requirement of the priesthood holder being worthy.  It's occured to me that this worthiness for the priesthood isn't just a nice thing - being able to use the priesthood at any point in time is a matter of survival. Reality is a messy thing.  As we live, all kinds of crazy things can happen. Being worthy is a necessesity, it's the only way that we can be ready to take of things that require th e priesthood.

Let me show you a video of an excellent example from Elder Holland. He tlaks about a pretty rare situation:

SHOW video

How many of you have been shocked by lightning? Over the last twenty years, I've hread there's about 51 lighting strikes that result in a fatality - tha'ts efinately more than I thought there would be.

My goal in showing this is to say any moment, we may be asked to use the priesthood, so essentially being worthy all the time is the only way that we can be ready for what comes our way.

IN a talk that Elder Bednar gave, he clears up some things about the priesthood.

**A priesthood holder is expected to exercise this sacred authority in accordance with God’s holy mind, will, and purposes. Nothing about the priesthood is self-centered. The priesthood always is used to serve, to bless, and to strengthen other people**.

The priesthood is interesting in that it is partialy meant to get us out side of ourselves, na dlook to the needs of others. priesthood is service. I think it's cool that God would give us some amazing power, and have it meant to be used not for ourselves but to those around us.

In the rest of his talk, he talks about a man coming to learn the gospel. He knew that the priesthood was something special and wanted those in the church to realize what the preisthood was, that it is something that was lost, and then restored. It has a huge ammount of value, and is a core reason why the restoration of our church was so important.

He has an interesting section in his talk where he speaks on his experience.

**“Please Help My Husband Understand”**

**At the conclusion of the temple recommend interviews I conducted as a bishop and stake president, I often would ask the married sisters how I could best serve them and their families. The consistency of the answers I received from those faithful women was both instructive and alarming. The sisters rarely complained or criticized, but they often responded as follows: “Please help my husband understand his responsibility as a priesthood leader in our home. I am happy to take the lead in scripture study, family prayer, and family home evening, and I will continue to do so. But I wish my husband would be an equal partner and provide the strong priesthood leadership only he can give. Please help my husband learn how to become a patriarch and a priesthood leader in our home who presides and protects.”**

**I reflect often on the sincerity of those sisters and their request. Priesthood leaders hear similar concerns today. Many wives are pleading for husbands who have not only priesthood authority but also priesthood power. They yearn to be equally yoked with a faithful husband and priesthood companion in the work of creating a Christ-centered and gospel-focused home.**

**Brethren, I promise that if you and I will prayerfully ponder the pleas of these sisters, the** **[Holy Ghost](http://lds.org/study/topics/holy-ghost?lang=eng)** **will help us to see ourselves as we really are (see** **[D&C 93:24](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.24?lang=eng#23)****) and help us recognize the things we need to change and improve. And the time to act is now!**

The best way that you can prepare for your mission and then marriage is to work to master the priesthood that you hold. Being worthy of it, and knowing what it means to serve will be a core part of your life.

One of my favorite aspects of the priesthood is to help my family with their own ordinances.  I had the chance to baptize my daughter last year, and will be blessing my 4 child soon.  It is an incredible experience to be a actual physical part of helping to bring salvation to my own kids. What an incredible reason to want to be worthy as much as possible.

I'm so greatful for the gospel.  I am thankfulthat god loves us enough to let us serve in his name. I know that if yo usearch for happiness and success in your flie, you don't need to look farther than your own worhtiness to serve in the priesthood. and I say this in the name of Jesus christ amen.
