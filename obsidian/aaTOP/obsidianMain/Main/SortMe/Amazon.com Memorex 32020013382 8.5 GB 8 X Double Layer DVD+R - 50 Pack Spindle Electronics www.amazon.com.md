I've been shopping for the least expensive DVD+R DL online, and found this Memorex 50 pack for around $50. This seemed the best deal around only if they worked!!!
I had used Verbatim [Verbatim 2.4x Dual-Layer DVD+R DL Spindle, 10 Discs](http://www.amazon.com/Verbatim-95166-Recordable-10-Disc-Spindle/dp/B000B018VO/ref=cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk) in the past with no problems. So It was a gamble to order this item after reading many negative reviews. After receiving this item, I started burning DVDs and had no problems at all. Every single Memorex DVD+R DL seemed to work perfectly!
For those who had trouble with this item I suspect a software or hardware incompatibility issues more than a problem with these disk. I use a 17" Apple Laptop Computer (2006 model) with a G4 processor at 1.67 Ghz. The software I used to burn the DVD's is Roxio Popcorn 3.0.2 (recommended) and the hardware is the built-in Apple Super Drive.
Compared to the next choice of Verbatim at $1.65 per DVD :[Verbatim DVD+R DL 8.5GB 2.4X 20pk Spindle](http://www.amazon.com/Verbatim-95310-Recordable-20-Disc-Spindle/dp/B000GHWRIK/ref=cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk) at $33 (today's price--I've noticed the price on the Verbatim to fluctuate from $32-$38- The memorex at $1.00 per Double Layer 8.5 GB is the best deal around with no quality issues.
Pros:

I was a bit worried when I bought these disks, having read the negative reviews. And, sure enough, the first burn made it only halfway. So, reflecting that the new thing about the disks is their speed rating, I slowed the burn down to 4X for the second try. I've burned three at 4X with no problems. In conclusion, if the first one fails, maybe your hardware or software isn't really ready for 8X. Just slow it down. The disks are (apparently) fine.

I bought a spindle of Memorex DLs based solely on the price. I was aware of the bad reviews, but I just could not justify paying nearly $2 per Verbatim DL disc when I could split movies or burn data on 2 single-layer discs for less than 20 cents a disc (or 40 cents compared to $2 for the same capacity). A costly mistake to buy these.
Out of 20 discs, less than half even burned successfully. The bad burns would fail as it started writing to the second layer. On the successful burns, the discs would stutter and freeze in my DVD player when it started playing the second layer (yes, I can tell where the layer break is). People touting successful burns with Memorex mean nothing! And I don't have the time to run PI/PO error checks or even watch every movie or video that I burn! The worst feeling in the world is watching a burned DVD a month later and finding glitches knowing that your original recording is long gone from your PC.
My advice is to stay away from Memorex at all costs. If you factor in a conservative 25% fail rate with Memorex, you'll see that it's cheaper to just buy Verbatim. This doesn't even account for the wasted time or the value of your movies or irreplaceable personal videos. If you are just burning data, stick with cheaper, more reliable single-layer media. I personally would never use any DLs to archive important data files. Just because you've owned commercial DVDs for a decade now means nothing. Keep in mind that those DVD-9 double layers are not even burned on a chemical dye which degrades over time but pressed.

I've been through 3 packs of these and had only 1 or 2 disks that ended up as coasters. Both of which are my fault. These disks are Great and work perfectly every time. Most of the people who are having problems are probably having a buffer error because they're computer is slow and can't keep up with all the data that's being burned to the disk. Just because the disk can Handle 8x doesn't mean your pc can. Please try burning these at 2x-4x before you go blaming the disk.

These discs burned fine, I have already burned 15 at 8x and had no problem. My firmware is up to date, before the firmware the first 2 I burned, only one worked, so I think it's more of a firmware issue. I have always had the best luck with the Memorex DL discs, and these are just as good. Try it slower or upgrade firmware for your burner.

I make and edit DVDs and burn to these. I have never had a problem with having to toss a disc because I couldn't burn to it (EXCEPTION- I did have one disc in an older pack from a previous order) that the double layers came apart. It squeaked when slightly flexed and I didn't attempt to use.)
My last order of five spindles (250 discs) I have had no issues with the first 150 discs. I am not expecting problems with the remaining 100 discs either. I use these for my business and cannot afford to have disc burning issues. I have been happy with this purchase. I just keep waiting for prices to drop on the DL discs.
If you experience problems, or before you order, ENSURE you hardware supports these discs. Ensure your driver is up to date.
UPDATE September 2010
I continue to purchase Memorex discs exclusively and have not had any burn failures. Have purchased from multiple sources and continue to have outstanding results. However, my computer uses SATA DVD burners. Possibly the hardware makes a difference?
