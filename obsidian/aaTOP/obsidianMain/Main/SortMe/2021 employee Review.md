Emp review - need to cover some context stuff first:
\- I never got back to you to chat eaileri, there was a few things I had hoped to cover:
     - I don't expect trivir to do anyting about some health items unlss you have ideas, other than thank you for the health care coverage; had some new findings regarding my health.
1 - Need to mention a few things about my health:
    I've recently learned more about two of my medications.
    - One really plays with my brain and I found after about 3 months or so, it doesn't seem to work for me any more. Starting and stopping the medication is pretty difficult and causes all kinds of problems with sleep, creates a different kind of vague anxieity; I'm finally off this one for now, and searching for something better.
         - The meds are for anxiety and depression -
         - To be straight with you, I don't have a solution on this one, and I'm currently not optimistic that there is something that works; I just dn't deal with feeling medicated very well; so I may need to learn to chat with some one to resolve things.
    - Second med I found is bad for my joints - so being old, fat, and takikng this second one is again screwing me up; but I can't get off it yet; still working on a plan; this med also makes me tired.    
    - Also recently had a friend of mine die from from a heart attack - Ive' always had a heart murmur and am not generally healthy if its not already obivous.
         - still working with doc on this one, due another blood test, so we'll see hwats next.

*  I have been walking a whole lot more lately, and that has had a srprisingly positive impact on my mood and anxiety - I need to try out the walking treadmill if I can.
	

2 - Iv'e been working to be a little less anxiety driven by sleeping more both at night and during the day -  and unfortunately this means my hours are a little more split throughout the day. I feel like hours I get from this are better. I think my hours are a bit more scattered througout the day, and I think it's worked well for me and Trivir; though I'd like to hear your feedback when it's appropriate.
     - have been finding that I'm less tired when I am working, whether it's at home or here.
     - Ccone

3 - widget turing.
    This year has been kinda odd.
    - Had a reasonable start, ahd a few wins on BAES with some design work with Glen which was good; helped to put together some stuff for ECR185 - conract length work, and helped put together some design for a new driver.

    - then , Since February, I've been working mostly with Southwest, the overall experience has been quite positive I think both for us and them but it has an odd side effect of giving me such an insantly large pile of box one and box 2 things to take care of; that I've struggled thinking of doing any sort of additional training as every hour is burried under an avalance of things that deeply interest and challange me.
    - I do feel like I've had some major wins here, though there's still a lot to do.
         - I believe every IDM engineer on the engineering and core team has benefited from answering Git, IDM, eDirectory, general problem solving. Everyone of them know that they can call me with these kinds of issues, and they will either have a solution or a promising next step when they're done talking with me.
    - I think I caught the tail end of how our utilization is like 80% now, and something abou how training is chnaging; I'd like to hear that again.

* Shared documentation . .CR
* Big items - Huston - Lot of beneif tto southwest - to using IDM, consider ways to stream line . .
