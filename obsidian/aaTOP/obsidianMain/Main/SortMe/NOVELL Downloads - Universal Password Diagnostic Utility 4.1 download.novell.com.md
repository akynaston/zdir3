### abstract

The Universal Password Diagnostic Utility 4.1 (diagpwd) is a tool that allows an administrator to view the Universal Password status for Simple, NDS, Distribution, and Universal passwords.
This update resolves symbol errors when running the utility under SLES and eDirectory 8.8 SP5 or greater. This update also provides 64-bit builds of the utility.

### details

The Universal Password Diagnostic Utility 4.1 is a tool that allows an administrator to view the Universal Password status for Simple, NDS, Distribution, and Universal passwords. \\
Prerequisites:
Linux workstation
LDAP SDK (novell-NLDAPsdk)
Windows workstation
Novell Client 4.91 SP3
To use Diagpwd:
Extract diagpwd-4.1zip to a Linux or Windows workstation.
For Linux workstations:
1\. Copy libnmasext.so to /usr/lib
2\. Make diagpwd executable by doing the following: "chmod 755 diagpwd"
For example:
bberger@sd1:~/diagpwd4>cp libnmasext.so /usr/lib
bberger@sd1:~/diagpwd4> chmod 755 diagpwd
bberger@sd1:~/diagpwd4>./diagpwd

For Windows workstations:
Open a command prompt, Start | Run | Cmd | change to the directory of diagpwd, then type diagpwd.exe
For example:
C:\\diagpwd.exe
Note: You may also pipe the output to a file by using the >filename.txt option, if the password is supplied inline.
Note: To verify the version of diagpwd, use the "-v" option.
For example:
For Linux Workstations:
bberger@sd1:~/diagpwd4>./diagpwd -v
diagpwd version 4
For Windows Worksations
C:\\diagpwd.exe -v
diagpwd version 4
DIAGPWD Usage:
: IP address of the target LDAP server
: The LDAP Secure port (SSL) of the target LDAP server (typically 636)
: DER encoded file of the Trusted Root Certificate for the target LDAP server or Self Signed Certificate from the Organizational CA. Please see section below on "Exporting SSL Certificate to a DER file" for more information on how to do this.
: LDAP DN that specifies a container or an object (in comma format). If this parameter is a container DN then the Password status will be shown for all objects in that container and subordinate containers (depending on scope value selected). If this parameter is a user then the Password status will be shown for the user.
: Values may be base, one or sub.
: The LDAP DN of the administrator (in comma format) that is requesting the operation. (example: cn=admin,o=novell )
: The password of the administrator specified by the parameter. Note that this parameter is optional. If it is not included on the command line the user will be prompted for it.
Exporting SSL Certificate to a DER file
In iManager:
iManager | Novell Certificate Server | Configure Certificate Authority | Select the Certificates tab | Select the Self Signed Certificate tab | Export | Uncheck the "Export private key" option | Verify the Export format is "Der" | Next | Click "Save the exported certificate" link and save to the desired location.
In ConsoleOne:
ConsoleOne | Browse to the Certificate Authority (CA) object (found in the cn=Security container) | Open CA object | Select the Certificates tab -> Self Signed Certificate | Select Export | Answer "No" to Do you want to export the private key with the certificate? | Next | name the file, such as c:\\RootCert.der| Next | Finish
Output of Diagpwd.exe:
The output will display the user(s) DN, email address, date of last password change, as well as their password status and Password Policy assigned.

Password: \*\*\*\*\*
Windows example:
diagpwd 192.168.79.32 636 C:\\cert.der cn=user1,ou=users,o=novell base cn=admin,o=novell
Password: \*\*\*\*\*
One searchScope examples: (One level searches search the object's immediate children specified in the searchBase)
Linux example:
./diagpwd 192.168.79.32 636 /home/user1/cert.der ou=users,o=novell one cn=admin,o=novell
Windows example:
diagpwd 192.168.79.32 636 C:\\cert.der ou=users,o=novell one cn=admin,o=novell
Sub searchScope examples: (Sub or subtree searches search the object and all its descendants specified in the searchBase)
Linux example:
./diagpwd 192.168.79.32 636 /home/user1/cert.der o=novell sub cn=admin,o=novell
Windows example:
diagpwd 192.168.79.32 636 C:\\cert.der o=novell sub cn=admin,o=novell
Note: If you run DIAGPWD against a user that has a Universal Password Policy assigned AND the user has not logged in yet (after the Universal Password Policy assignment), DIAGPWD will update the following attributes on the user: Password Minimum Length, Password Required and Password Unique Required. DIAGPWD will read the assigned Universal Password Policy and update the user with the corresponding values from the assigned Universal Password Policy. These same three attributes are also updated on a user upon the users first login.
