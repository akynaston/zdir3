I'm glad you got it working. I'm sure you already ran into similar information but it is also possible to achieve the same thing without the virtual router package by using the 'netsh' command (although the virtual router package is probably easier):

The instructions also show how to setup the internet connection sharing afterwards.

And just out of curiosity, I looked to see if there is a samba server for android and there is. Theoretically, you could enable wifi tethering on your android device (creates ad hoc wireless you can connect to from the laptop) and then access the samba share on the android phone after connecting to the ad hoc wireless network from the laptop. As long as you have a data plan on your phone you could also access the internet from both the phone and the laptop (utilizing the phone's mobile data connection):
