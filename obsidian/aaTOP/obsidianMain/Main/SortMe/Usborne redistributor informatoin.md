# Usborne redistributor informatoin

Kelcie, I have a bunch of questions about Leah becoming a Usborne book reseller. Do you mind if I just ask them here?
\- It's 40 bucks to start right? I'm guessing that's just to get her set up in the system, and it's normally 140 - why the discount?
     - February is a deal, so it's only 40 for the startup books.
     This is fine. She won't need to have any inventory. With her startup it includes 6 months of her website where people can order books from. After her first 12 weeks she can then request consignment inventory if she'd like
\- what other costs are there? are you saying she'll need to pay the 40 bucks again after 6 months?
Ok, the inventory isn't required? I just didn't want her to have the burden of maintaining a supply/demand until she's had some successes. So the 40 bucks covers some things: -
    what other costs are there? are you saying she'll need to pay the 40 bucks again after 6 months?
    Right. Inventory is not required. After the first 6 months it's  8 a month to keep the websites. If she chooses to do prizes or giveaways during parties, she'll be responsible for that (prize + shipping). Then if she chooses to go to national convention she'll have to pay for that (price varies year to year). There are also optional business supplies available
8 bucks a month?
It is mandatory. It includes all of the back office trackers and the ordering
website for consultants and the ecommerce website for customers

\- I can see how usborne make their money; what percentage of a sell does Leah get? She'd need to sell quite a few books just to break even right?
As a consultant she'd make 25% on each sale with a 4% Bonus each month that she sells $1000+
Average book is 10 bucks, so that's 16 books up front to pay off the 40 dollars, and 3 or 4 a month to break even; ok good to know.
  - What kind of a discount for new books she wants to buy?
  She'd make 25% on her purchases as well, so more like a reimbursement than discount

\- ah cool, ok. So for the most part, Leah would get a picture of the book (either through through an usborne re-distributor website, or taking the pictures her self, the promoting the books on her own (aka through web site, word of mouth, book parties, etc) right?
    correct

\- Leah mentioned you had some kind of trip as a reward, I assume it's something you won for selling books for quite a while?
\- and if she ever wanted to stop; is there any kind of 'disconnection' fee, or early termination fee?

    No fees to stop. And there is a trip each year that anyone can earn. It's based on sales and recruiting
Very cool - I think that's it for now, I need to chat with Leah a bit, then see how to proceed here.  What would be the next step if she wants to sign up? Just chat with you?
    Yes.
