Lots of these days we do something similar - how about Thursday, what do we do?

Saturday - what do we do on saturday?

Lets see what we're supposed to do on each day:

Exodos 20: 8-11

 8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

 9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

 10 But the seventh day _is_ the sabbath of the Lord thy God:_in it_ thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that _is_ within thy gates:

 11 For _in_ six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them _is,_ and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowedit.

So every day we work and go to school, and work and school an work and school . .. The sabbath, or sunday is meant to be a day that is set aside for resting spiritually and physically.

Can you gys think of anything that we're not supposed to do on Sunday?

IN Jesus christs day, they were really strict about it - some of the people thought that they essentially coudn't do anything - Let me show you a video:

Jesus did something on Sunday that some people didn't think was ok to do. He heald somebody! some of the guys were mad at Jesus, because they didn't really understand the purpose of Sunday.  IN fact, jesus taught them that some times some work has to be done on Sunday.  Can you guys think of some pepole that have to work on Sunday?

some times I have to work on Sunday just becuase I need to go travel and go some where for the week, I have to go to the airport, so I cna get to the place I need to be by Monday morning. As you grow up you'll find that some times it takes a lot of work to make sure that your Sundays are a special day.  I have 4 little crazy kids that are little tornados. Feeing the spirit on Sunday takes a lot of effor tand extra work.

The church put out a video where we're supposed to record what we do on the Sabbath and share it with other people - kinda of a cool idea - lets watch.

One of the cool tings about technilogy, is how fast we can learn new things, and that we can turn around and share what we learn and do with other people.

Take a quick break and tell you a cool story.
Last Thursday, the owner of my company came had said that we want to do a different activity that we han't done before.  down to Utah and took our whole group on a Cnayoneering trip, it was amazing. I would like to show yo ua few pictures, and show you what it was like.

Let me show you a few pictures, and video.  going through some of these things was amazing, because it taught me how incredible our world can be. When you decide what you ware going to do on Sunday, you have to think is this activint going to bring me closer to the savior, or does it make me think about something else?  for my family, being in beautiful places as a whole family, is soemthing that I love.  I love to go on beautiful drives,a nd se the incredible canyon - espeiclaly this time of year when things are changing, and moving into winter. Seeing the amazing planet we live in with my family seems like a good activint to me; but you still have to decie for your self.

I am thankful to Heavlenly father for having the foresight and planning to make sure that we have specific places and times where we can focus on feeling the spirit and loving the savior. Using Sunday to recharge and make sure you know how to feel the spirit and get closer to god is an amazing blessing - what I'm going to show you is some incredible video and pictures that we got while we were on our trip, it was an amazing blessing.

Shonw canooneering videos.

I say these things in the name of jesus christ amen
