We use my number for staffing and pipeline now, as well as the Monday call.  Plus the East Coast standup is on it most mornings.  Other than that it's not used much.  I can see if it is being used if you want to IM me first.  I used it this AM for an licensing issue, but that was not a usual thing.

Hope this helps,
Julie
