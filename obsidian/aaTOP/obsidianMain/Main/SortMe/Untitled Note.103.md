How to fix openwith on Windows 10     

<http://superuser.com/questions/13653/how-to-set-the-default-program-for-opening-files-without-an-extension-in-windows>

Just found some cool commands to help fix file/program relationships:
assoc: define file types so they can be assigned with ftype

assoc .xml=Notepad++\_file

Assings .xml file to notepad++

ftype: assign file types to programs

Note: these settings require an admin elevated cmd.exe.
