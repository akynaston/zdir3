God Speaks to His Children through Prophets

President Brigham Young taught that our “first and foremost duty \[is\] to seek the Lord until we open the path of communication from God to our own soul”.

To me, this means that God can talk to me if I am ready to listen. It is amazing that God still speaks to his children.

President Brigham Young also taught about a woman that received a blessing full of revelations. This is called a patriarchal blessing. These kinds of blessings are a blessing that we get in our lives that are excellent personal revelation. They teach us things that we really need.

I am really greatful for reveleation in our lives.
