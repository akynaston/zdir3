# Untitled Note

Lesson - Feb 8-Feb15, 2015

Today is going to be really cool, because we're going to talk about something I know we all enjoy.  video games! 
Have any of you ever played a really good Video game?

What made it good, what did you love about it?
      - A good Story?
      - Exellent play control?
      - Excellent sound/music?
      - Maybe even good character development? a Good story?
      - Companies like Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony, Naugthy Dog, Ubisoft - these are incredibly successful  companiess that have done a great job.
     My question for you, What do you think goes into building a game like this?

      - Hard work
      - Talent
      - Skill
      - Years of Experience
      - Years of Education.

     How many people work on a game like this?  
     (hundreds?  maybe thousands?) - groups of teams focused on one specific piece in the game, and even sub groups within those groups focusing on yet more specific pieces.  There is probalby a team that fouses enturely on lighting.  ON getting shadows, reflections, and light sources just right.
      - there is a Team entirely devoted to sounds.  Maybe even a sub team working on sound effects, and another one that just concentrates on giving just the right ambience.
      - there's a team entirley devoted to animation - making facial expressions look just right, leaves on trees, and blades of grass move just right in the wind - all the things we take for granted, but provide an amainzlgy relaisint experience especially in some of the new games coming out for the latest consoles.
     **How is it that thousands of people all can work together on something like this, yet produce something thtat it so coherent and consistent?**

     **They must have a plan.**

Tell me about a  plan, what is it?  
(It's  a detailed proposal for doing or achieving something.)
(Answers:
 - Provides definition for success: it gives a company or group of people a target, and allows them to know when they got there.
 - Allows any number of people to remain in sync, and regularly refer back to the shared agreement for what the end product will be.
 - Allows people to take on different responsabilities, and even yet more people to coreograph the pieces together into coherent pices that are closer to the final goal.
 - Can be as detailed as needed to record a clear end goal.
)

Last week Brother Mortimer talked about a plan, can you tell me what it was?

                    So I think we agree that a plan is something that is not only good, but even necessary to make it possible to complete something that is complicated, has multiple steps and needs to be organized. God had a plan for us, you may have talekd aobut it to some degree, he had to put together the plan of salvation.  We know that Adam and the savior had to create the planet, and had clear direction from God about how things were supposed to be, first taking crae of the lighting, then making landmasses come together properly.

**What is your part of the plan? What are you responsible for?**

These were all initial steps to give us a place where we could come and be tested.

\[Whether or not they went over plan of savlation again, quickly outline the parts:\]
Can any one tell me about the parts of the plan of salvation? What kinds of things did God have to consider?
     parts of the plan:
     Birth
     Death
     Sin/Repentance/Obedience
     Two most important parts:
     Choice and 
the most important key element of the plan of salvation is the Atonement.

I remember when I  heard of Death as part of the plan. It seemed kinda odd  it struck me that something that is painful both for the person involved and loved ones could be by design, and part of the plan.  Then it occurred to me that this life is setup in such a way that we had to completely leave the presensce of our Father so that we could be in a place to be tested.  

So the plan is that we are here to be tested.  Any of you ever had to take a test before? It requires that you see various questions then make a choice for each question in how you are going to respond. This choice is the whole point of the test.   

We can see that if the atonement was the most important part of the plan, what it does for is should be our top priority.  As you probably talked about last week, the Atonment takes care of two problems - do you remember what they are?  Spiritural and physical death.  The physical side is something we get just because we are God's children - Thats pretty cool  isn it?

The part that isn't free gave us this thing we call choice.  

(someone) do you think that since the atnonement gave us choice that it would be something that's important?  Yes, choice is essentially everything. In fact, one of the God head's purpose in being is devoted to enticing us to choose what is right, to be a companion with us in this crazy planet.

During a recent conference, President Monson gave a talk about the three R's of choice.  I'd like to read just a little bit of it.

Read:

Intro
ALWAYS HAVE RIGHT TO CHOOSE:
     (someone) do you believe that? 
third: President monson then mentions how the cheshire cat in alaice and wonderland has an interesting line.
(     after Cheshire line) say - Do you guys know where you want to go?

To have a choice, you have to have multiple options, and even enticements to go one direction or another. Adversity then becomes something that is good for us, another key element in our salvation because it pushes on us.  

Some times adversity comes from our own poor choices, while others its from things that simply happen; but in every case, even our response is something we have full power over.

\==================================
ENDING
I am grateful for the plan of salvation. There is quite expected out of us, but only because we've been given so much. We hve so much power to work to bring to pass our own salvation and the salvation of others. If you look at the peoople in this room, and the peolple that should be in this room, these are people we are responsible for. God expects us to make the choices necessary to be saved and bring as many as we can with us.
