# STORY*** - MYRNA AND THE PATH

When I walk down the dusty path pushing her heavily Laden cart full of bread baking materials She Came Upon a group of Thieves that appeared to have stopped for the night and we're relaxing she was mildly irritated to have to stop and interact with this group but it was her responsibility so she pushed forward. As she got closer to the group one of them came over to her and said, "hey what do we have here," in a rough and gravelly voice. She looked at them calmly, "Excuseme good sir, might you have any water to drink? An old lady such as I needs enough water to drown a camel".

     "Sure we have water", said the rough voiced man. "But we ain't sharing it".
Inwardly, Myrna shook her head.  Strike one she thought.
     "In that case, I'll be on my way".
