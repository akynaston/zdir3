# Test Mail Server Tool

Test Mail Server Tool is a full featured mail (SMTP) server emulation to test mail sending capabilities of a web or desktop application or to preview messages before they are actually sent. This is a great tool for web programmers or application developers who need mail server for tests but don't want to install one.

The program listens on localhost on a SMTP port (usually 25, may be changed). All mail sent to this tool is automatically stored and optionally opened with your mail client.

Points of interest:

* Web developers -- test and debug mail sending features of your web site.
* Desktop application developers -- test, debug, preview messages sent by your program.
* Office managers -- preview messages before sending it to clients and colleagues.
* Other users -- add mail preview feature to any program.

Other benefits are streamlined install, ease of use, small size, and easy uninstall. One of the important things is that this edition of **Test Mail Server Tool is free**.
