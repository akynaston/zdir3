# Every year my family and I go to eat from where we cut down our very own Christm

Every year my family and I go to eat from where we cut down our very own Christmas tree from we go up into the mountains and cut down our Christmas tree I like it very much sometimes we bring hot dogs and hot chocolate and act like we are camping for a while. It is a lot of work and there is a lot of snow but it is very fun to go cut down our very own tree. Sometimes grandpa lets me ride in his car when we go get a Christmas tree grandpa likes to get the biggest Christmas tree he possibly can its so tall I can barely see the top it's fun to watch them pic of the tree. They pick up their saw and walk out far away from our camp and find the perfect tree that 16 feet tall then grandpa takes the axe and then begins to cut down the tree sometimes it takes him a long time because it is a big tree and then when he is done cutting it down he yells timber and then we all run away so that the tree doesn't land on us and then after we have all of our Christmas trees grandpa put them on the trailer and ties them down really tight so that we can drive home safe when we get home grandpa has to tie the tree down so that it doesn't fall down and break things in his house when Grandpa has tied to tree down grandma start putting the lights on and it's such a big tree that it takes so many Christmas lights after a few days Grandma's done decorating the tree and she makes it so pretty I love getting my Christmas tree and our tradition to cut down their very own tree it is very fun.
