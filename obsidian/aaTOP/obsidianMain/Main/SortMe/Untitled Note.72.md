Andrew's Noah talk 9/2/2017 5:53:26 PM v3

My talk is about Noah.  Noah was a prophet of God.  God asked Noah to build a boat. I like Noah because he was brave and decided to build a boat to obey Heavenly Father. Even though other people made fun of him and thought that he was silly for building a boat away from water, he decided that he would work hard to do the right thing and obey God.

When Heavenly Father asked Noah to build a boat, I bet he was really nervous. Noah even had to make all of the tools that he would use to build the boat. I think Noah was really faithful that God would help him know how to build the tools first, then helped him build the boat. 

I'm thankful that Noah was a good example and a good prophet to help us learn how to obey God even when we think that we can't obey. I say these things in the name of jesus Christ amen.
