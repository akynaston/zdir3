168th priesthood session

Nelson
Bare. To hold a weight.

Authority but no power. Blocked by sin, pride, laziness, demean wives and children .

Here to qualify ourselves, not just to while away the hours

Only the diligent will be able to do it.

Only those who have paid the price.

Priesthood heals both earth and mind.

President young men followers and leaders

Ucthdorf old couple affection
Was a perfect woman would they be interested in u?

Pride is great enemy of charity. It hides behind clever excyses.
