BEEF ENCHILADA CASSEROLE

1 pound ground beef
1 clove garlic, minced
1 onion, chopped
18 corn tortillas, torn into bite-size pieces
grated cheese

Sauce:
1 28-ounce can tomatoes (I use one quart of home-canned tomatoes)
1 can enchilada sauce (We especially like this with a 17.25 ounce can of Pace Enchilada sauce)
1 8-ounce can tomato sauce
½ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon chili powder

Brown meat, garlic, and onions. Drain off any visible fat.  Add sauce ingredients, and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes.  Layer sauce with torn tortillas in a 9" x 13" pan and top with cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.  Also good with a can of drained whole kernel corn, and/or a can of olives.  This recipe is from Andrea Gunnell at Phone Directories Co., Inc.

(If made as above, without corn or olives, and with 4 ounces of cheese, makes 12 Weight Watchers Servings, 6 points each.)
