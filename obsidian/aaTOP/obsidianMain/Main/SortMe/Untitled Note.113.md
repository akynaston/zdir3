I realized I hate using the word religion: makes it sound like somethin that's outside of us; when in relaity; this love and timelessness of things is all around us. I can lookat some one and see them from baby to old age and separate their body from their timeless spirit. When you see past this time; you see people for who they truely are. Even chuck full of physical issues, crappy choices, amazing talents you can see souls, and suddenly a deep humulity washes over you, a kind of awed silence. This is what attracked me to Leah so much, and what I think has made me so close to mom and grandpa seaver: their spirit is extreemly close to their skin: I don't know if htis comes about from righteous living, or is simply one of their talents: people that are easy to respect have this: it's like their body seems to matter less and less; an that it's only a focal point for their spriti.
