# SSP - Flyer introduction

I just have one item

\- the 4th sunday of every month, we have something caled teacher council. This is a time where all of those that have a calling to teach a lesson every week can get some training for teaching.
\- The problem with this, is that many of these teachers are in the primary. the last few weeks, Sister Johnson and the rest of hte primary presidency has had to take care of the kids. While they are great kids theres a lot of them.
\- As a ward, we would like to give the primary presidency a break and have some of you sit in primary with the classes during the 2nd and 3rd hour.
You won't need to to teach a lesson, but we do need you to help keep the kids under control.
Next week is the fourth week, it's February 25th, we need to sign up about 6 or 7 people to sit with the classes during the 2nd and third hour next week.
With that said I need you to do me a favor and do tw things

1 - Then please sign your name and number on this clipboard;
then 2nd - please come take a flyer and some chocolate motivation.
(we probably don't have time to pass out the clipboard here, but I'll be going around and looking for subs.)

If you are a teacher, please meet on the stage either during the 2nd or 3rd Â hour to receive some training.
