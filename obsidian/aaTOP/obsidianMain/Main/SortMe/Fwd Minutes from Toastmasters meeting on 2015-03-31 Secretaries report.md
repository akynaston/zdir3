Toastmasters,

This week we had an excellent speech from Joe, and some awesome Easter themed Table topics.  Here's what we did:

 - Welcome of visitors
 - Joe Cook: Prepare to Prepare, Spectacular Achievement is always preceded by unspectacular preparation.
 - Table Topics: Kevin Ford: Easter theme
     - Susan: Traditions around easter
     - Jesse: Santa: might just be the Nintendo in the closet.
     - Eric Aroca: Doesn't know what the Easter Bunny looks like, and would prefer to eat bunnies rather than try to imagine what they look like :-)
     - Eric Aroca: Easter plans: Go Bass fishing with a belly full of bunnies.
     - Raylene: Santa: the real truth.
     - Leslie - Easter traditions & love of family.
     - Linda - Baby Chick story (Aaron wipes a tear . .must continue report . . .)
 - Raylene General Evaulator
     - Rosco Allen: "Whats in it for me" review of Joe Cooks's speech.
     - New member: Jason
 - Meeting reports
 - Joe Cook then stood and gave some awards:
     - Kevin Ford: Competent Communicator
     - Roscoe Allen: Advanced Communicator (I guess that means he beat Kevin right? :-))

Please let me know if you need more/less info, and more/less attitude :-)

Thanks guys!  Toastmasters is AWESOME ;-)
