# [Zelda] Special Horse You need now

\[Zelda\] Special Horse You need now
Full instructions with spoilers: [Special Horse](https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-guide-walkthrough/2017/3/9/14859942/how-to-giant-horse-breath-of-the-wild)

This horse can help you get tons of rupees too: <http://www.evernote.com/l/AAZ6XOZNp3FM1IyXjEyL3ypKKXZVY7ispy8/>

First you need a little under two wheels of stamina. You should get all stamina from shrines. 
**You CAN swap back and forth between hearts and stamina!** (<http://www.evernote.com/l/AAYtpXJXmrNLIIIYak6T0bCsLIa61mFvaeM/>)
So don't worry you can always switch to the other

Once you have enough Stamina. Go here.

You will head to the Taobab Grassland. 
If you travel back to Owa Daim Shrine, then it’s only a quick paraglide trip away to the cliffs of Mount Faloraa to the south. 
Once on the cliffs, look west and you can spot...... Something special :)

To mount the Horse with some reliability, you can use something that will increase your stealth (either a piece of equipment, a meal or an elixir). 
The added stealth isn’t mandatory, but it’ll make it less likely to spook — and the Horse will run a good distance away if you scare it. You can also try scaling a tree and then paragliding on top of it.

Once you mount the Horse, repeatedly hit the L button to soothe it until it calms down. Be forewarned: It will take you roughly a little more than two stamina wheels worth of strength to tame it. We’d recommend tackling this quest either later in the game or when you have the right kind of food that adds additional stamina.

After you’ve tamed the Horse, simply ride it over to the Highland Stable to register it. If you haven’t unlocked the tower in that area, simply head south until you reach the Nautelle Wetlands, then head east until you hit a road. Follow it east until it forks, take the northern fork, then keep following it until you hit Highland Stable.

**SPOILERS**

**The horse is so big, you can just run over enemies. This is really useful for fighting. I have even rammed and killed Guardians with my horse! (Still wasn't easy, but very fun and very possible. I circled the guardian till all his legs busted off lol.**

**The BEST part is that you can use it to hunt by running into large animals, cooking meet, and making TONS of rupess. (Like 10,000 and hour).**
