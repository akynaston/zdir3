# *WORK TRIGGERS

**Increasing my ability to recgonize and alter my state of mind at will, and constantly and fully understanding work I'm doing are  the two most valuable skills I can have. Every time I've stuggled in anything at TriVir, it was due to a poor state of mind, or a lack of understanding.  Everything that we talk about right now, will be related to increasing my ability in these two areas.**

**What it boils down to, is that I choose to work here, and I will be successful as long as you choose to work with me.**

**Some of these items seem obvous, but apparently are not as I've struggled with them.** **Every single time my mind was clear, and myundrstanding was full, I was successful - I asked the right questions until I fullyundrestood, then completed items properly within the time alloted.**

I should include a bit about my wife in our discussions, but I don't want this to turn into a venting, but I do want to talk about her as it relates to my state of mind at work.  My goal is to increase my ability in these to areas - I want to eliminate any drama - we either make money here or we don't.

Sources of frustration:
 - Feeling pressured to complete something just added to my todo list: solution: using toddle do has nearly completely solved this.
 - lack of confidence in my own decisions, especially during this time.
 - being on probation
 - The feeling that working with me has now become . . .less than positive
 - miss-communication with my wife
 **- landminds - see #20 below**

 - 'Duh' situations should be triggers to translate into a change in everday habits instead of just crying..  A duh situation is when you or Huston say to me, Well, why didn't you do it this way?  Why didn't you follow the pattern?  It's occured to me these should be triggers for change instead of crying and feeling bad for myself.  The following items were triggers that came up over the last little while.  

Sources of Clarity:
 **- Submitting my time every day at the same time (typically 4).  While this sounds rediculously simple, this has had incredible side effects, the most obvious being that I have a much higher chance of getting my time in correctly every week, forces me to have a natural time to ask for openair tasks every day, gives a strong feeling of something accomplished every day, helps me to concentrate and complete the day well.  I'm toying with the idea of moving it to 3 to have this success earlier in the day.**
 **- Following the single principle of keeping a todolist and project histories**\- Everything from random project todo items to keeping a list of items needed for a campout has improved, stress from forgetting things is almost completely gone now. Project specific todo item lists has helped me record even small priority todo items to pick back up when I move back to projects, helping me to keep valid billable stuff in my pocket for projects that might have future time buckets.  The project histories has helped me remember the last point I was at with every project.
 - Making measurable and positive progress on projects seems to be a source of happiness, and keeps me focused . .

Huston and Michael can do for me:
 - I'm putting triggers in place to have a more proper reaction to ask questions when I'm assigned something, but I could use help in growing int hat ability to fully understand what I'm doing, instead of just being a processer where I'm fed something, and do it - Maybe occasionally ask me what I think I'm doing, or help me to remember to repeat what I just heard.
 - My ability to make my own decisions, or to escalate something is absolutley required.  I would apprecite your contiuned frankness, in telling me, Aaron, this is something you should have found out on your own, or telling me how a certain type of decision or choice can be made in a certain situation.
 - I need to increase the quality of status responses - you can help with timing and amount.

pscy:
 - Fears: loosing control: steering wheel in car like childs jungle him steeringwheel
 - 7/27/2010 11:02:00 AM -  is maxed. -  for money for items, then suddenly more purchases.
    - she's extreemly manilutplative . . .
 - Learn to deal with great amounts of frustration, and learn to avoid them in the future
 - I blame my wife for this frustration, yet, I am the one that decides what I think and feel, does  help, but I still feel knotted up.
 - I'm very happy to ahve kids and love them so much, but it's made it so much more frustratiing - there's major external reasons to work things out . .
 - I don't process her venting very well for some reason - I feel (and know) that she's beeing so illogical, and ist just a bump ona  log - has no motivication to do anything for her self.  I feel like sh'es an invalid some days. It's as if she has no desire outside of barely surviving, and I don't want to be part of that any more.
 - Wife's interuptions at work: guilt - but should only be choice and consequences.
      - 7/29/2010 11:03:54 AM- example: gave me phone number to call to sign up holly for soccer - high priority for both of us, but she isn't comfortable doing it - I am very comfortable calling, but the interruptions cause frustrtation.
 - She called again 7/29/2010 11:06:27 AM- guiilt, more frustration - She ambushes me on the phone, won't let me get off - very clingy, I want to show her how much I love and care for her, but It's hard to know how much to give of myself . .I don't trust her at all, if I give, she'll take until I have nothing left to give.
 - 7/29/2010 11:07:40 AM - just im'ed me - are you ignoring me?
 - 7/29/2010 11:09:39 AM- I responded: I call at lunch to sign up holly for soccer - nothing so far . .
 - She has nothing to do at home, but roast in her own drama . . if she has a job, she just increases the drama, and then we need to pay for a baby sitter, and she wants to keep all her money for her own spending money.
 - I love her delary , but lis like living with some one that doesn't fulfill her responsabilities - she's not getting a freeride here - I can't afford it (time and money), neither can our family
 - 7/29/2010 11:12:40 AM - immed again - more details on soccer - apparently, she may have called  .
 - I don't know how to cmmunicate to her, that I need to work when I'm at work - I do try to call her at lunch, but many times, it just becaomse a yap session, or an ambush.  She's just a black hole of need some times - I want so badly to fullfill her needs, but I have no clue how - and I have a nagging suspicion that she should be self sufficinet to some degree right?

**1 - Understanding is required:** Understanding is not just nice to have, it's required.  Before making a code fix, emailing, talking, calling, I will understand clearly what my goal is - Habbit 5. Very rarely, will I need to forgo understanding in an effort to reduce time. This is probably my core issue, every other goal on this relies on this one. 6/28/2010 3:53:24 PM  - Just had incident with Glen: It turns out that I did what he asked me to, but because I didn not clearly describe or give my response proper context, he was unable to see that the issues he handed me were related to other issues.  If I repeated back to him what I had planned on doing, and then couched my response under the same context, he would have not been confused.
   **Desired effect**: I always have a context of understanding for every situation, thereby enabling me to have an educated opinon on current items, all the way to remembering better the things that I have done in the past.

**2 - Pre-approve, or pre-accept tasks**: be able to describe in detail to Glen, Michael and Huston what I am doing.  (situations where Huston or Michael is seem suddently supprised that I chose something, since I made my own decidsion)
    **Desired effect:** Every time I do something, it will be very clearly defined, and fully billable.
 
**3 - Gauge:** Live in a gauge: The last few projects I've had open air tasks and estimates up front. I found that I was much more aware of my estimates, because I could clearly see how I was working within my estimates. The key here, is that I've included all of this in my spreadsheet, and can now create estimates, and check my progress easily, and not require openair tasks to keep me straight, yet at the same time, I'm probably adding about 2 minutes of extra work a week to do this tracking. This gives the project  manager a chance to be a proejct manager, multiple situations with Huston. This has a few beneifits: I can estimate every second of every day.  I can have a record of how my work matched my estimates.  I can total and share hours between subtasks on a customer, to ensure I'm still within the over al estimate, still making money.  Clearly though, the biggest benefit though, is that I'm consciously aware at all times, that when I'm billing,  I"m on a clear task, and  essentially drawing money from a preallocated, properly estimated bucket, and that has been communicated to the project manager and customer.  
**Update 7/28/2010 11:30:07 AM**\- **Benefit**: When things go wrong, I can clearly and almost immediately separate the time spent debugging: this will help to bill properly, and more importantly, make me aware at all times how much time I"m spending on things that have typically in the past, put me int he weeds.

Now that my spreadsheet includes a specific subtask per customer, I can now estimate every last second of work that I do - now I can practice estimate 

**4 - Work only on money tasks:** All of my work I do here should be categorize-able under one of the following categories: triage, code/fix, test, deploy, archive.  Every switch between these tasks, should always be completely concious. This came up from an issue I had the other day when trying to decide what to do with my time.  Once I have everything written down and prioritied by money tasks, it's no longer a problem.
**5 - Awareness of pipeline:** Since I will always have my work estimated, and have a gage with which to work, I will always know when I will need more work.  This should be regularly communicated to Huston and Michael.Another goal of my estimates is to help Michael and Huston keep me billing constantly, and smoothly shift between projects.
**6 - Things go wrong:**  Things will go wrong occasionally.  Historically, this is when I panic, pick some useless road and go down it, because it makes me feel comfortable again. I've realized for some reason, Openair was helping have a clear picture of what I have to work with, then I had an epihany - openair is just a tool, I can benefit from simply recording my time per task in EVERYTHING I do, and check it regularly.
**7 - TriVir and it's customers are mine:** Whenever I have a task to accomplish, don't fall into the 'I"m glad I don't have to do that mind set' (Experience with groups GBMC AC, my first thought was a general feeling that  oh good - NMichael took this one I don't have to do it., then I almost laughed out loud, and said, holy suck - not only is this a good chance to take a wack and some english practice, this is also a great time to take some work off your plate.  Because Trivir and it's customers are mine, I should choose to take care of both, and be just a little more absorbent when it comes to responsabilities.
**8 - Anxious Time = Clean up time:** The moment I notice I am anxious, stop, clear my mind, then continue, but I need to be completely honest with my self. (call with Michael, GBMC, my time was running out, anxious, said mailbox instead of home directory).

**9 - I need to act as if my 'house' is already clean:** I realized that if I were to leave TriVir right now, I wouldn't have a clean story to tell a new employer - I would want nothing but beaming recommendations from Michael, Glen and Huston in particular. I kept thinking that I can start good habits of having a clean house at home after my house is clean - thats wrong: I need to behave as if my house is already clean: cleaning up after my self ect.  If I already had a good review from Michael, Glen, Huston, I know exactly how I would act, and always be inspired to do better.

**10 - Context switching concern:** Huston has repeatedly expressed a concern about context switching (7/8/2010 9:54:23 AM Qualcomm ADScripting driver to OHAG time -659 issue) - I suppose my TDBanks/Qualcomm messup was the trigger.  Ideally, I'd be able to handle 5 or six projects at a time.  I believe Hustons' concern is based in the fact that if I have something sitting on my shoulders, I tend to rush and make mistakes in trying to 'get it of fmy shoulders' . . .

**11 - Management of discussions with Leah:** Since my state of mind is the most important thing at all times, I should only be answering the phone when do a clean context switch to her, then back without any residual frustration.  communicating to her through email is helpful, as it strips out all of the wait time, and most of the jabber we both have.

**12 - Bug Bombs/ Caught Pants Down:** 7/14/2010 10:07:19 AM - just had discussion from Glen about bugs in the Active directory driver.  These are the most dificult fo rme to handle - it's as if I'm screaming that I should be fired, and I'm not sure how to respond to this.  During these times, I need to be very sure that my state of mind is completely clean before continuing.  Since I had no idea why I had made some decisions, especially when I was aparently 'adamant' to glen about having the 'login disabled set to false' rule in my policy, and now I have no idea I ever said such a thing.
Solution:
 - To bug boms: I've got to realize that I will write bugs, but I can minimize the impact (see pants down below), also, I need to not get into a sorry for myself loop.
 - to Pants down: I need to know why I made certain decisions.  If my code for any reason is not standard, it needs a comment.  I need to be able to completely repeat why I made certain decisions every time I write code.  If it is not completely obvious, I need to rethink, then comment.
 - I realized, I think I got in the hapbing of feeling bad, because in some insane way, I feel like I"m immediately resolving the problem by feeling bad; where in relaity, it's just creating a new problem: a worse mind state, and not thinking about the solution.

**13 - Miss-communications:**  7/15/2010 8:46:34 AM Just had misscomunication with Hustoon: lastnight, he said "first thing, install 3.5.1, apparently, I did not hear that he also said 'if it's not before standup, give me a call'.  I had no feel of the urgency that huston felt.  This morning however, I can tell he seems quite urgent - I get a compeltely different communication, that there's a lot of work that needs to be done.  
Solution: two sides: I herd no urgency in Huston's voice, almost just a light suggestion of what I would be doing - yes, come in,a nd complete the buildscript, then do the upgrade, If there is a tighter timeline, I need you to say we have a tigheter time linte.
 - There have been some times hwere I said back what I was going to do, repeating back a list of action items has been successful every time, mentioning all nouns in the discussion: servers, jobs, code to write.

**14 - Not getting enough sleep:**  7/15/2010 8:49:37 AM I found that going to bed before 10:30 is required.  anything later, and I meediately feel defensive, and struggle making good decisions.

**15 - Defensivie ness:** I frequently feel like I'm under attack, and respond poorly.  There is no attack, there is only making money or not making money. (BTW: Huston seemed confrontational today, perphaps frustrated with me . .)

**16 - deep frustration:** 7/15/2010 5:37:43 PM  - plantemoran work . .
 - It occured to me: if I can get regular feed back, when I'm in feedback mode, this is very helpful..

**17 - working together: 7/21/2010 1:23:12 PM - epiphany -** feeling better, working better with more people in the office - Glen, MIchael huston, carl jer all here

**18 - 7/27/2010 9:57:13 AM** - last week, my jobs received from anyone, I have simply accepted as todo items, not working to understand.   When I fully understand what a customer wants, (whether that customer be internal or 

**19 - STandards - 7/27/2010 10:41:46 AM**\- Talking about and clearly understanding, and adhering to standards gives me a great deal of mental clarity and relaxation.

**20 - landmines: 7/27/2010 10:56:45 AM -** I just spoke with hustona bout sharing idmunit accross projects for plantemoran - i realized I already have an idmunit - non cr for the AD sid update driver, now I have this cr copy for the adam driver tests. my concern is that now that Huston has told me how things should be, later, he'll see htis and say, I  I told aaron to do this differently - but I am choosing, and rightly so, to not spend any time ont his, but to add an itme to my customer specific todledo list to colean it up when I'm back on that project!

**21 - Plate notes -** Keeping a prioritized list of what's on my plate has been very useful in helping to make sure I don't drop anything. even the itemst hat are of lower priority.  It also helps a lot to deal with my OCD to copmlete everything on my todo list.  Toodledo has helped as well in this area.

**22 - Messy car vs project todo items:**  Oppostite ends of the spectrum: why do I put some things on my OCD list and others aren't there?

**23  -Putting first things first: expecations of customers and most visible items:** I need to spend more focus/time/energy on the things that are most visible first: these are the things that are the core of a customers experience - then, the worst case scenario is that they have their expectations met - any remaining time can be spent upgrading to a BMW.

**24 - instead of complatining about an issue, focus on becoming an expert on it.**

Notes:
 - Knowing that I suck I've found, doesn't help at all - I still need to be able to keep my job.

Working from home rules:
**1 - Notify family that I am unavailable.**  Basement office works fantastic, as I can be separated from noise and kids.

Small changes I've made that have had an extreemly positive influence:
