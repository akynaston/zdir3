Â - Why do you believe in God (assuming you do)? (list reasons).
Â - Why do you believe that you have a spirit (assuming you do believe this way)?
Â - Do you believe that consciousness is real or is the result of chemical & neurotransmitters &Â  . .what-not ðŸ™‚

**Why do I believe in God?**
**Short answer:**
I believe in God because I choose to.Â 

**Long answer:**

	Many things on this planet can be proven, and many can not.Â  I realized whether or not we can prove that God exists IS BESIDE THE POINT!Â  If we suddenly were able to do some sort of existential test and say yes or no, I realized I still would want to act as if he did - it all STILL boils down to what choices I will make in life, REGARDLESS of how we got here.
		There seems to be at least some value to taking this apparent situation of shared consciousness with our family, friends and strangers, and bring some real, lasting happiness to the world. This isn't something that requires the existence of God. While this statement feels almost overly clinical to the point that the discussion about God is totally useless, I feel like it is still relevant. For example: If I had indirectly sent some one on my family to take care of a task; I would want them to be so independently strong that they could take care of or work through the task despite the fact that I asked them to do it.
		
	Â I don't believe in 'just in case' faith: this seems like a version of faith that doesn't even comply with it's definition, and seems haphazard and completely missing the point.
		At first, this distinction that I'm making: about 'as if' vs 'just in case' may seem insignificant; but for me it makes all the difference. 'As if' for me, is the heart of the correct kind of faith. 'just in case' feels like a completely faith-LESS cop-out - a plan B with no meat to it.
		
	Keep in mind that this also means that it is possible that somethings that I have 'faith' in could potentially be completely wrong; but again, it's beside the point. if some concept inside or outside of the Gospel can edify in some way, then I will have faith in it and this 'correct enough' for me.
	
	I believe the spirit has continually and personally revealed to me that God is real and does love me - as frustrated as I am with basing something so important on a portion of something happening inside me (which is a place of a storm of chaos and fallibility LOL) - this is still enough to make me satisifed.
	
	I should say that I am still DEEPLY curious to actually and fully find out one day (along with all things that require faith), I've just chosen to move his existenceÂ to a 'secondary' question while I will firmly hold as much faith as I am able in his existence.
	

I think too often we confuse our choice of how to behave with our curiosity of how the mechanics of things work.Â  Take the atonement for example.Â  What an amazing, powerful event that we're taught all of our lives, and I still have no idea how it is possible. I still don't understand the level of love and patience required by God to let this be done, let alone the raw mechanics of someone expiating sin. However, I choose to believe that the savior died for me and will live as if this is nothing but truth.

I hope this doesn't sound like to clinical of an answer; but it's the most complete and satisfying answer I've been able to come up with. I've chosen not to get tangled up in trying to prove something that cannot be. Ultimately; making good choices is the end result - as funny as it is to say; I think we can make good choices because of OR in spite of God existing.

**Why do you believe that you have a spirit (assuming you do believe this way)?**

**Short answer:**
Since I have the capacity to doubt my own consciousness, I feel like I can fundamentally say for myself that I have a spirit, consciousness, or otherwise non physical component to what I would call me.

**Long answer:**

	When looking at this life in a purely biological perspective; I think it is easily to believe that we're just a bunch of people that have exploded in this natural accident over the years; and therefore have very little biological value - we're just a spec on a spec in this massive universe.
	
	I 'feel' too much. There is too much in my head, and too much feeling of what I would call the spirit that leads me to believe there is a hidden depth of time within myself that says there is "too-much" to me to think it could be an accident.
	
	The Earth's placement in the universe, along with a host of other things (the earth's ability to rebuild itself, Jupiter's asteroid catching capabilities, the size and position of the moon with respect to Earth and the Son etc) are all too perfect to be an accident - HOWEVER: it's important to remember that we're cherry-picking here: when looking at evidence, its easy to believe that this is a special situation; but should remember there's only one cherry to pick here ðŸ™‚ (Hear more: End of the earth podcast by Josh Clark) - the fact that this earth exists, means that there was a hand in its creation that gave us a place to live, learn and grow; all of which implies a MUCH larger context, then what would merit just a few decades of existance.

**Do you believe that consciousness is real or is the result of chemical & neurotransmitters &Â  . .what-not ðŸ™‚**

I ask this because it the reverse question to whether or not you have a spirit and provides a different point of view.

**Short answer:**
I believe our spirit is what contains our consciousness; and that our spirits know how to interact with our bodies, and stay put as long as certain basic rules are met (see spirit question above)

Long answer:
