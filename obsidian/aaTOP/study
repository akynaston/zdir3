starting point for serious study?

why do I have faith? I believe I do have it, and I seem to have a very natural ongoing...contemplation on God, Jesus, and the purpose to all of existence...

we already know that this reality is made up of tiny charged particles... so things that are physical are more of an energy than something... substantial.. it's almost as if this life feels just real enough to forget that we are creatures of thought, faith, hope, and emotion...it's like the physical is just a rough sandbox where our apparent separate consciousness can interact with one another... as if it only matters enough to put our minds in separate cages, where only a small amount of input can get in (5 senses...).  and even our senses seem to all embody some element about filling ourselves with that what's is true and light.

So here we find ourselves apparently conscious, and able to experience a wide range of experiences, some that would seem to increase our quality of life, and some not so much.

as a race we came up with language. we organize ourselves into cities, towns villages and homes. we realize we had physical needs. all of which can be satisfied to some degree or another.

side note: I decided that I am LDS for some specific reasons. the knowledge of the nature of God, and deeply overwhelming amount of Hope taught of in the church.
