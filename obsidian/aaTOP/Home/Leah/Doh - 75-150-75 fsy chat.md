Leah,

Crap monkies, I am so sorry, I was totally wrong. I was making three mistakes that confused me pretty bad. LOL - I should really only focus on one complicated thing at time, it's all my brain can handle.

I love and respect you so much, thank you for being patient with me.  I am now completely happy with the situation and don't feel a need to do anything.  Not realizing the fact that it was FSY reimbursing YOU AND ME, and YOU AND ME reimbursing the church was my biggest mistake.

Thank you for setting me straight :-) I'm glad I didn't bother Mike with my confusion.




1 - Us reimbursing the church the 75 on step 5, was a little too proactive: we were going negative to payback money that we hadn't been given yet; I technically should have waited until today to do that.
2 - I was wrong on my argument that we ended up with extra money on step 3 . . I got it in my head that we had made money here, when in fact, step 4 shows we were even.
3 - There are three groups of people: Us, FSY and the church. We paied FSY, The church paid us, then we reumbursed the church, and FSY reumbursed us.


1 -       0 - we start at zero, no one owes anyone.
2 - -150.00 - we paied to get andrew & holly
3 - +150.00 - We got reimbursed
4 -       0 - all good.
5 -     -75 - Andrew decided not to go, that means we are now 75 dollars in the hole (THIS IS WHAT I MISSED, the fact that we went negative here)
6 -     +75 - We got back the money from the church back from FSA to our card. (THIS IS THE SECOND THING i GOT WRONG - There' actually 3 groups of people here: the church, us, and the FSY folks, I think that's what you were trying to get into my stubborn head.
7 -       0 - back at zero, and evertyhing is all good.
