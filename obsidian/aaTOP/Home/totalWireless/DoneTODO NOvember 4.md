Around October 4th, My family started a new 4 line plan - we got everything configured; then found as the last step that someone had put us on an old depcrecated plan that is going away - we had lots of issues around texting not working on one phone, and moible data not working on another
 - I spoke with Juan and he mentioend we needed to get put on the latest 110 dollar plan that has the first line at 40, then 30, 25, 15
 - - Something about disneyplus and a wlaamanrt subscription.
 - - unilmited shared data and 15gb mobile hotspot.
 - Can we do this?



Juan asked me to call today and get my plan fixed.  Back around October 4th, my family started a new 4 line plan.




My faimly just setup a 4 line plan:
 - one of the phones has no mobile data
 - another has no texting.
 
 - also wanted to potentially ad anohter line to the account, and get plans.
