3 year plan

- Love to deeply increase automation
	- Specifically around IdMUnit - I think the goal is that as soon as a PR is approved, we'd merge, and optionally get a new build of IdMUnit depending onw hat was pushed.
     

- I have a sense that I should come up to speed on forgerock, other competitors for idm and products, and then ping and other authentication products and services.

[TriVir] 2024 Aaron employee dev plan notes
Huston, Mike,  
  
Per our conversation, my dev plan for the next few months is as follows:  
  
Goal: generally begin to further entrench Gary into SWA.  
  
 - Extend Gary's contract past April  
 - Work to move Gary into an advisor role  
 - Push Gary further into being the point man for SWA activities.  
  
We'll do this by identifying box 2 activities that Gary can report through stories, and retro-style meetings to show that TriVir needs to continue being a core part of SWA work.  
  
 - Other items, such as automating IdMUnit builds and getting more training, I'll focus later on in the year.  
  

--Aaron
