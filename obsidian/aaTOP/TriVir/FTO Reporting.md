Bob gave me a write up on my FTO this year:


**Year to date FTO**: 125.25 Hours  
**Planned FTO**: 112 Hours (June 18-20 and July 11 through 25)
**Remaining Holidays**: 32 Hours (Labor Day, Thanksgiving, the Friday after, and Christmas. **Note**, Juneteenth, July 4th, and Pioneer Day are captured above in your planned FTO)

 

Total FTO (Taken and Planned): 269.25

Normalized (you have 12.75 OT hours thus far): **256.5**

FTO Balance Available: 63.5 hours (320 minus 256.5)  
  
**Note: This does not include any planned time off for the Holiday Break (Dec 26 through 31).** That could add another 32 hours, leaving you with 31.5 hours for illness and emergencies for the remainder of the year.
