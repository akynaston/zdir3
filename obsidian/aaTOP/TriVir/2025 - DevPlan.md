Preparing email for Michael and Huston

Mike, Huston,

Here's my dev plan items we discussed for 2025:

* Become an IGA Leader:
	* My main push generally now is to be an IGA leader. Using SWA and any other resources, work to be able to walk a client through a new IGA project.
* Schedule a Git training with Huston:
	* Have Huston start with the Git internals discussion, then Aaron talk about merging and rebasing, 'RERERE', and tips and tricks including work trees & useful aliases like 'git s' alias.

Raw notes

Plans for this year

I had the phrase 3 year plan at the top of my notes last year, and I think it ended up being more of a 10 month plan.

While I am quite happy on SWA, I do understand that there's more to do, and more to contribute elsewhere as always.
	 - Ever since your comment about me being content turning widgets, I realized it is so true. I am fully content being in a NetIQ IDM driver development loop - write code, pass test, commit, deploy, write code pass test, commit & deploy.
	 - Continuing to do the same thing I've done for 25 years, with 17 at TriVir seems to agree with me.
	 - I am both willing and happy to do whatever; aside from being somewhat isolated from the rest of TriVir, and not contributing much elsewhere, I enjoy where I am it.
	 - 

* I know having gary come on, and possibly me roll off was the plan. so I ahve two questions here:
	* That was the plan right?
	* Just to make plans, good to talk about expectations for my involvement at southwest.

* I'd like to get a good sense for what Trivir is seeing, and get some training there.
	* Sailpoint at SWA - some basic reviews with Jim which were good.
	* I found the developer portion of their web site - seems like a standard REST setup, more than one oauth method.
	* I'd like to spend some significant time here.
	* Kyle and Baron are the only one that have access right now, and they're working on bringin it on line: sounds like there's a bit of setup they need to do on their side. . . I'm am a little upset about not having already been included but Kyle knows my intent, I'll keep pokcing around.
	* I'd like to see what TriVir can do to have our own tenant if possible.

be focused on extracting value as a client


Get taiin g from swa!!!

sail point, veza... 

Jim and Bob... Jim on point for sales. 
  Jim on iga.. iga practice.
tonight leadership on iga..


* Forgerock and Ping
	* AM and IDM, getting more Ping exposure would be good: knowing a basic authentication flow for ping seems wise - The CE side o fmy team talks about SAML assertions quite a bit  - I haven't worked with SAML for probably 8 years; but have a basic idea
	* 



 - Seem to always be doing what I've always done, don't reach out a whole lot to other technologies.
 - Comments about last year plans
	 - Really overwhelmed and a bit bumbed out of what I've seen for the git stuff - the git exercises tool was a bit of a failure with the requirements they have
	 - Lost a lot of my motivation. Still really love Git, and learned that people are intreested in more about rebasing.


***git merging and rebasing internals.


 - I've enjoyed the exposure to Forge Rock AM stuff - it's interesting to learn the different kinds of pain involved in the product. You quickly realize how spoiled I've been having clear log files that actually tell me what is happening.


*frodo on ping side...
all products.
ci cd..
ping aic..

*be an iga guy.


 - Loved the  stuff I learned on Jenkins and the build; lots of little questions here and there, but would need to end up with a practical and building tool.
	 - questions around selecting the image + software used in doing the build
 - 



pulling value to me... from swa, then back.

by 50, working on something else.

3 year plan

- Love to deeply increase automation
	- Specifically around IdMUnit - I think the goal is that as soon as a PR is approved, we'd merge, and optionally get a new build of IdMUnit depending onw hat was pushed.
     

- I have a sense that I should come up to speed on forgerock, other competitors for idm and products, and then ping and other authentication products and services.

[TriVir] 2024 Aaron employee dev plan notes
Huston, Mike,  
  
Per our conversation, my dev plan for the next few months is as follows:  
  
Goal: generally begin to further entrench Gary into SWA.  
  
 - Extend Gary's contract past April  
 - Work to move Gary into an advisor role  
 - Push Gary further into being the point man for SWA activities.  
  
We'll do this by identifying box 2 activities that Gary can report through stories, and retro-style meetings to show that TriVir needs to continue being a core part of SWA work.  
  
 - Other items, such as automating IdMUnit builds and getting more training, I'll focus later on in the year.
