We have created a page in Confluence that explains how to securely share passwords and other secure information. The short summary is:

- We should never share passwords, credentials, or other secure information through Email, SMS, chat, Slack, or other insecure method.
- Sharing secure information should be done through 1Password.
- If you do not have access to the vault related to a project you are working on, ask your PM and they can add you.
- You can share items with clients using secure sharing links in 1Password.
