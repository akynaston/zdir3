to All

I know there was a lot today in our meeting, so here is a quick (okay, LIE, here is a long) recap of the information I shared.

1. Our new insurance company is called Allied. They work with the Cigna network and are part of the Allstate umbrella.  They "rent" Cigna's doctors and facilities lists but manage the program so they can negotiate our rates.
Prices for premiums will be relatively the same. We will continue to cover 90% of the premium, you will pay 10%.image.png 
In-network total out-of-pocket will remain the same. We will no longer have the “all kids visits are free” benefit. 
Please stay in-network. Doctor and facility lists can be found on cigna.com. In the past this has been a non-issue; out of 1400 visits last year, there were 12 that were not in-network. But just for the future, be careful to stay in-network.
One specific I did not mention in the slide presentation was that ER visits are $350. That is a $50 change (currently we pay $300 at the ER).
You can find the most up-to-date information for prescription medicine on Cigna's website Drug List. The prescription drug list is "Advantage Tier 3". Choose our list from the drop-down menu. CVS and Walgreens are both part of the network.image.png·
2. New FSA platform

We will not be able to use UHC's FSA program for 2025. We will have a new FSA administrator, they will be great, you'll be able to have an app and put in receipts from your phone.
Because of this change, the UHC portal may be unavailable to you starting sometime in January. You can still use your funds if you have not spent them yet. But you will need a special form to request reimbursements by email or regular mail (Confluence will have more information shortly).
WE STRONGLY encourage you to spend your money and get your reimbursements settled before the end of the year. You still have until Mar 30 to get reimbursed, it will just be harder.
The new FSA medical limit for 2025 will be $3300. Dependent care will remain at $5000 per year.
3. UHC Rewards will no longer be available

Push/redeem your rewards, and get as much as you can out of the program. Have you had an annual checkup? Take the health survey, and track your sleep for two weeks...do everything you can to get money from the program. 
4. Healthiest You will be gone

Allied also has a telehealth platform which we will use for the same kinds of visits, including a mental health network. Their platform is called "Recuro Health".
 

5. Guardian (Dental, Vision, Voluntary Life, Critical Illness) will not change.



6. Health Reimbursement Arrangement

Please check your IN-NETWORK medical spending for the year. Get on the UHC website and look at your annual expenses before we make the change to Allied!
Visit the HRA page in Confluence for details on whether you can receive reimbursements from TriVir for out-of-pocket, in-network expenses.
If you have spent enough to qualify, use the link on the Confluence page to request a reimbursement and upload your spending information.
7. Open Enrollment will start on Tuesday, November 19th, at 8 a.m. EST

You'll receive an invitation from Employee Navigator for open enrollment in your work email address.
Please call Becky if that invite does not show up first thing Tuesday morning, or if you have any questions at all.
The enrollment period will end on Monday, December 2nd.
Thanks for your time, have a great afternoon.
