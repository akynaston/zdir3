Huston,

During our chat today; we discussed the following:

 1. Aaron needs a new dev buddy with Cameron gone.

 2. Create an outline for Git training: get approval on ideas.

 3. Jenkins: Create pipeline 'hello world' on  new repo - do the following:

1. Fail pipeline & email creator of PR if:

1. Check style fails.

2. Tests fail: will use src/main, src/test file format.

3. (optional/extra credit)See if there is an auto-detection of functionality changes:

1. Find a way to fail the pipeline if mix of formatting and &functionality.

* Also note: will run finance numbers to chat at the conclusion of my avoidance window ;-).
