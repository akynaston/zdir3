SAML example today; starting here:

![[Pasted image 20250319120705.png]]

not really a limit to payload size . .reminder it's a post example - going between idp and browsesr . .then brwoser sends to Idm - assertion comes back to browser . .the brwoser becomes the transport mechanism . .
 - security around htis is problematic
 - could have some one change SAML response - digital signature proves that the data came from the IDP.
 - signature is like a notory.
 - sp will trust signature: originall imported a cert: app owner imports certificate for IDP
 - basically configuring app to trust assertoins from SP - meta dat aexchange has to happen before . .
 - certs they're based on have expiration dates.
