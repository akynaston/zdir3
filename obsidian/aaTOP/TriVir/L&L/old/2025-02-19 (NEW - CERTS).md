interesting:
public and private keys aren't necessarily alpha numeric keys . .
 - both can encrypt . .
 - private can be used to generate public
 - some times encrypt private key, digital signature - anyone can verify
 - Encrypted with public key - only people with private key can decrypt.
 - Very rarely public = private key encryption: most of the time, generate shared secret: symmetric key: then encrypt this with public or private, then all data is encrypted with this.
Certificates - describes how key can be used. helps enforce - just metadata  ..

trust store and keystore can be the same thing - subtle difference in the purpose only.
 - if some one gets keystore with private key would be bad news.
 - If some one gets trust store; also bad; but just defines who we trust.
OCSP - Online Certificate Status Protocol
* may be difficult to implement vs CRL; but looks good

CRL - can't be cleaned up . . issuing a new cert isn't too bad - 4000 revoked certs at Census is painful ;as people hve to go get a new one.
CRL is entirely enforce don the client side.

Nonce - iniitalization vecot to initialize encription

X509 certifiates

	Java 1.8 - System.setProperty("com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.disableEndpointIdentification", "true");

Issuer chain - deceptive in windows - makes it look like your cert has the full chain; need to make sure my cert has ful chain when neded.

PEM encoded - you can look at it tos ee i the chain is in the file.
full chain is needed when servers can't reach out to get higher issuers in chain - BAES app is an example, per Jeremiah.

Should always be doing secure code - start with the security portion
 - Web browsers are sometimes now warning if going to an http non https website.
 - Some apsis in a brwoser won' work if not using https . .
 - HTTP2 requires ssl . .
 - won't get cookies - when not on HTTPS
 - Intermediate CAs - trusted CA's are shipped with operating system . .new trusted root ca is a big deal; so just use intermediate CA . .
 - lets encrypt CA's took a long time to get out to everyone
 - inermediate certs used to sign everything - more easily to.
 - Browsers WILL NOT not trust cert with validity peried longer than 398 days.

SSL/TLS
TLS - alwasy reverign to this - SSL means TLs in most cases unless followed by a version

last - mutual auth - both sides trusting bidirectionally.
MTLS - 

zero trust networking  is an example - difference in MTLS - using both keys for connection and authentiatoin . .

Next week - Public Key authentication
