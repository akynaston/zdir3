Federation - delegating authentication & authorization to another system.

tree/journey - the same thing.
Clouds: everything is called journey
XUI UI - same thing

Looking at authenticate section in the chrome network -> preview

Creating child realm will get a COPY of the trees from the parent . .

 - States in a tree . . states store the data
	 - 3 types:
	 - Shared state
		 -  between inner journeys and main journeyD
		 - Don't put sensitive unecrypted data here
	 - if put on shared and dn't take it off, always there.
	 - Transient
		 - 1 - next time callbacks sent to browser, this is wiped . .so short term data
		 - 2 - if I call from one journey to an innner journey, can't see transient, local to the current journey
	 - Secure state
		 - Say something will be used later.
 - password normally goes on transient state.
 - Tree executor -looks at life cycle, helps to keep stuf on the secure state.
 - In order to succeed - just have username in username field in shared state.
	 -  - whatever username is in this field is authenticated.
 this just reuires username to log in!

right now - self service journey - success node with the context in the shraed state, this is an authenticatd state.
if you don't want to suceed, send to a fail, then do acrobatics to make it no look like faliure

succss 200?
fail: 401

now going through nodes: combonents above.
data store decision - checks username./passwod

cool: shows a page with username, then a page with password, then checks, then success or fail

TriVir has source for nodes.
Data store looks at all of them - could fail in some, then find in others, makes trace funny
callbacks dn't create interface, ou can send jsavascrit to the rowser
is there a node with username/password - no!

There is a page node!
![[Pasted image 20241002124118.png]]
Page node: does let you stack like this
 - only last node in the page can have multiple outcomes
 - page nodes can't communicate with each other
 - but may as well write node that includes everything in it.
 - heads up: cloud doesn't give a warning when dropping stuff in . .

 Test my tree:
 http://am1.dev.trivir.com:8080/am/?realm=peopleavk&service=Jeremiah
LDAP Decsion: have more opttions . .
zeropage login: can read headers - conveneient: authentiating from system that has username/password - jus tputs them on the shared and transient state, just like username/password
- things stay in the store until end of authentication.
- CTS - token store . .
MFA, device binding nodes (bind device to user)
HOTP generator
OATH - totp - or HTOP protocol
when client asks for 'go back' option - no - can only go beginning to end.
otp sender and sms sender are the same.

Push authentication
WEbauthn - can use specific yubikey etc.
must do exatly was forge rock wants you to.
good docs  to help ou know which to use.
just search forgerock totp otp . . .etc.
account active desiion: can check . .
auth level decsion: can get deeper auth (kinda broken right now?)
* maybe synonymous with 'step up auth'
behavioral
	incremen tlogin count
	login coutn decsion
certificate login
cooke presence
device tampering verification
persisten cokie
custom ccokie
federatoin:
	incoming federations
	SAML
	almost havn't done any of these
	FCPS may do a lot of htese
next time work on journeys.
ideneity manager
	Use these lots
	not for accreditation; but use in cloud a lot to create/modify user
email suspend node: used for passwod reset . .
Get session data: can read data from auth session
if session exists, won't go into journey unless you force it to.
message node: mssage and button
meter node: metricing - how many people come thorugh here . .
polling wait node: can poll until user has confirmed.
spending more time in 'utilities' section
