SAML and Encryption . .
first pub/rpviate key
```

3*2 = 6

6* 1/2 = 3
```

3 is the message
2 is public key
6 is cipher text

This way the message can be deciphered.

SAML

Federation: fedrated identity/authentication: have a system that rovides authenication; how this providing happens, depends on protocol.
 - how the info gets used, is app dependent.

XML based markup language for security assetions
 security assertion markup language.
* idp provides auth and identity info
* sp - is the aplication 
* assertion: auth and identity info provided by idp
* ACS - locatoin in sp that processes provider
* metadata  - about idp tells sp how to communicate.
	* this file can be pretty messy depending on sp . 
	* will talk about contents later.
* binding: method through which exchange will be executed
* sso/slo: single sign on, sinle log out
* logging out . . oidc, and oauth have a concept of SLO

SAML: SP initiated flow:

SAML no dead - SAML commitie is disbanded . . sounds like it won't grow/change from this point
note 'wsfed' close to saml 1 . . .mostly saml2 ou there.
SAML1.1 appears in 'name spacing . .'

Binding:
* **Artifact binding**: directly communicate - this is default, and is most secure.
* Post binding: request/response through form post
* redirect binding: browser rediret
* generally a service will have a SAML metadata endpoint . . .
* Chrome dev ools don't show response payload some times
	* firefox are better: redirect/post bindings work best
* note: bookmarks of a login page may fail; as 'Nonce' may be missing
* 

SAML assertion example:

Example response;  . .not matching the one above  .

SAML integration - estimate: 30 hours .  . wild west ater meeting some very basic rules . .

Also note 'InRespo' - is a InResposeTo - has id of assertion request

SAML tracer . . tool to help debug this.
