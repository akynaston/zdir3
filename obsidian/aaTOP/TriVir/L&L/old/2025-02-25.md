slides on first doc, also here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QxszZr8H5Q51JKz9FKukUMZ035WRhyl4JIKdzhWLSwk/edit?pli=1#slide=id.g33149c3a789_1_33

Census - failed efile - was expired certs.
onscreen: Definitions - with TLS  . .now Trusting certs - can trust CA . .
onscreen: SSL/TLS - distinct protocols.
* Security in general: most connections support  a secure connection.
* "diffe helmen" key exchange: two sides have public keys - come up with symmetric key; the use that for communication.
* requires the public/private keys stored and used as appropriate.

TRowe Price - MTLS - Mutual TLS - both sides have keys; both sides have to trust. . .seeing more of this. "zero trust" mentality.

Avoid getting private key from customers . . .shouldn't be offered . .
When private keys on hardware, are typically very well controlled - like with a pin . .if lose 

Goals of TLS
* encryption
* authentication
* integrity

* Ensure confidentiality
* integrity
* authenticity

Interesting: SSL session id may be used to track users these days! HTTP3 - runs on UDP . . may help avoid this by giving more power to browser . .since OS does this lower level stuff at the moment

Debugging SSL in java with this:

Federation coming up; relies heavliy on signatures
