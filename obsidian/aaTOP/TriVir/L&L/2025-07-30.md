last time they did something . .

Looking at http://10.10.10.120:3000/ in a brwoser

powershell - curl -> invoke-webrequest

loking at http://10.10.10.120:3000/api/docs - swagger: gives full ui on rest service!

Looking at blog api, . .posted some mesgaes - mine failed . .

HAR file export: can get everything - on 'network' tab.  by default, chrome tries to 'sanitize'; but may do it incorrectly, and hide stuff that isn't sensitive or vis versa.

Everyting on ping runs on rest: Brian showing ping doing lots of rest calls
