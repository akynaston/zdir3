Git Advance notes

I found I use git all the time now, any time I have files that I care about that are not VMS, I put it into Git. I wanted to write down a few super cool useful tidbits that I've found:

 - Use git-filter-repo
 - The ability to clone a local repo to another local repo, and use the first as the remote!, simliar to a worktree, but a different relationship between the two repos.
