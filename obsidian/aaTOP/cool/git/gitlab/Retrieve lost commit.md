Just now I was rebasing IDtoDocunet on CSCE-1978, and had submitted an updated environment.yml. I found that I had inadvertently lost the .gitlab-deployments.yml file the pipeline had added; but from the pipeline, I could see this:

![[Pasted image 20240327173945.png]]

and had the commit id, 7972625!!  

I was able to go to: https://gitlab-tools.swacorp.com/csiam/idm/idtodocunet/-/commit/7972625

Tag the commit, pull it down, and recover it!! cool eh?
