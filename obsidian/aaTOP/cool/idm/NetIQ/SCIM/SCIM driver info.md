Goku/Nirosha had scim meeting on Friday . .

Have to deal with schema in one of three ways - see link below.


Application schema not imported by default; also not deployed at all, designer doedsn't give option to deploy.

bottom line: you have to manually import a schema file into the driver upon startup, each time yhou deploy it, no workaround that we know of yet.
