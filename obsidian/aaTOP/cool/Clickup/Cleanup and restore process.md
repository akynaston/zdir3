Good afternoon team,

Recently we have had some issues with accidental deletions of WIKI pages in the Trivir workspace. This email will hopefully mitigate these issues and help others to not make the same mistakes.

**Delete a Wiki/Doc**

Delete a Wiki/Doc you no longer need. Deleted Wiki can only be restored from the trash within 30 days of deletion.

From the Sidebar settings:

1. From the Sidebar, click the **ellipsis ...** icon next to the Wiki.
2. Select **Delete**.
3. To confirm, click **Delete**.

**To keep from deleting the entire Wiki utilize the ellipsis in the sidebar and not on the main page***

**Please refrain from deleting pages using this side of the ellipsis the functionality seems to have a bug that could delete the whole wiki**

**Recover a deleted Wiki**

Workspace owners and admins can recover deleted Wiki from the [Trash](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/6311742742423-Restore-items-from-the-Trash) within 30 days of deletion.

Additionally, members who both created and deleted a Wiki can recover it within 30 days.

To recover a deleted Wiki:

2. Click **Settings**.
