This meeting is regarding a personal item, and my end goal is to request advice, and make a long term plan. The major thing or catalyst that has happened here, is that Leah finally realized how goofed up our money is, and has picked you as the person I could talk to regarding money. She's really hesitant to include family I think because she would lose some autonomy around money.

We use YNAB now, and I it is accurate enough to be a super useful tool in tracking.

Goals:
1 - Come up with some specific plan I can follow to get my family out of this mess.
2 - Setup some regular accountability with someone, to prove we are staying on track with the plan; and define contingents for mistakes and emergencies.
3 - Learn to properly live within a budget.


YNAB report: 
 - Start by showing you actual numbers.
 - I am so far past my comfort levels, it's probably obvious, but this has been the number one reason for stress over the last 10 years or so.










Leah is finally on board to talk with someone outside us two, and you've been picked. As near as I can tell, you're close enough to be trusted and far enough to not be a family problem. Whatever her reasoning, I needed to talk about the severity of our issues. This continues to be a source  of distraction, depression, general pain. I'm on better meds now and think I can at least maintain my sanity; but it's getting bad. After making minimum payments, things are pretty tight. When I have to ask for a forward to go on a business trip, it's just getting silly.


YNAB has really helped to track actual dollar amounts, and has been a lifesaver showing us what we need to do:

Show YNAB: total without mortgage.

What I am asking from you is creativity for helping us to make traction towards resolution. I see two problems to solve as soon as possible:

1 - Stop spending more than we make every month.
2 - Come up with a plan to pay off all of our debt, as aggressively as Leah will allow.

DETAILS:

insert pain here, it is crushing me. What's worse is that I'm good at math! Didn't really even get serious about budgeting until 2018, when I realized I had no idea where we stood financially and we started using YNAB.

YNAB definitely showed a problem but I thought we had a plan in place, and apparently did not.  Since December, I've been running a full report showing all money related assets minus loans, and we come up with a scary number to see how the bottom line fluctuates.

Nothing is late; but it is getting close. If we were to have another major car issue, or appliance go out, we would be hosed. 

I'm on some good meds now that seem to keep me stabilized enough to function; but even that is 30 bucks on its own, and I"m taking two other meds in addition.

With all expenses going up in the goofy economy and with me traveling still; it has become even more stressful to try to balance things.

A portion of our debt is a HELOC, and I already have a 401k loan. 


I am looking for advice.  Of course the goal is to regularly spend less than we make, and seeing the overall number decrease in a sustainable way.


I desperately need to make traction.  I am willing to drop nearly any subscription or service; but would need to get my wife on board; and have her make decisions with me; but she is I think just now starting to be willing to change behavior - so progress has been gut wrenchingly so, but hope seems to be a posiblilty again.
