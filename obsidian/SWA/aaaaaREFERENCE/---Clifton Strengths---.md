I've not officially taken the clifen strneghts tests
I heard Harmony spoken of - that's a big one and important to me.
I'm curoius if there's something in clinfenstrongs about resource management - I know I'd want to get firewood, and find some reliable source of food and water; some way to communicate to airpoans and boats that are far off.

Good follower - I
