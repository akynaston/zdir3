Review links:

I think Yatin is working on a regular reviewer, on some time interval which I think I like; assuming that person available during that time. Either way, I wanted to share some useful links. The person doing MR/CR reviews can use these two links to do regular reviews:

CRs:
This link shows all CSEE CRs - I don't know if Ping related CRs need review; but it's a handy spot to go to, to help review crs if needed:

MRs:
Link to all open MR's in the csiam/IDM namespace. Again, I don't know if Ping related MRS need simliar reviews - I suspect there may be a simliar link for non IDM related MRs:
