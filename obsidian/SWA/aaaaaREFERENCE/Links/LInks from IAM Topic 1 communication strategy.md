MFA is an interesting case study on where resources are found:

- SWALife MFA initiative overview: [https://wnco.sharepoint.com/sites/SWALife-UserAuthInfo/SitePages/MFA-Home.aspx](https://wnco.sharepoint.com/sites/SWALife-UserAuthInfo/SitePages/MFA-Home.aspx "https://wnco.sharepoint.com/sites/swalife-userauthinfo/sitepages/mfa-home.aspx")
- Dash How To's: [https://southwest.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2F$knowledge.do%3Fsysparm_type_filter%3Dall%26sysparm_resources%3Dknowledge%26sysparm_order%3Drelevancy%26query%3DMFA%26sysparm_searchnav%3Dtrue](https://southwest.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2F$knowledge.do%3Fsysparm_type_filter%3Dall%26sysparm_resources%3Dknowledge%26sysparm_order%3Drelevancy%26query%3DMFA%26sysparm_searchnav%3Dtrue "https://southwest.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2f$knowledge.do%3fsysparm_type_filter%3dall%26sysparm_resources%3dknowledge%26sysparm_order%3drelevancy%26query%3dmfa%26sysparm_searchnav%3dtrue")
- Dash PingID MFA Help Guide: [https://southwest.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fx_soai_portal_deci_decision_tree.do%3Fsysparm_tree_id%3D0589d1f61b13a4d08878a8a82b4bcbac](https://southwest.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fx_soai_portal_deci_decision_tree.do%3Fsysparm_tree_id%3D0589d1f61b13a4d08878a8a82b4bcbac "https://southwest.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2fx_soai_portal_deci_decision_tree.do%3fsysparm_tree_id%3d0589d1f61b13a4d08878a8a82b4bcbac")
- Confluence Product Documentation: [https://southwest.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CYSEC/pages/74551699/PFE+12.+PingID+MFA+Implementation](https://southwest.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CYSEC/pages/74551699/PFE+12.+PingID+MFA+Implementation "https://southwest.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/cysec/pages/74551699/pfe+12.+pingid+mfa+implementation")

It should be noted that the SWALife page has links to direct users to the Dash MFA Help Guide and KBs.  I think SWALife, Dash, and Confluence have different audiences (users, Technology stakeholders, Cyber internal) and purposes.  It's just not well understood what those are.
