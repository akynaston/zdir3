<title>[CSCE-1862] IDtoCSS Fixes and Updates needed</title>
<link>https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSCE-1862</link>
<project id="10130" key="CSCE">Cybersecurity Customer Enablement</project>
<description><p>Two changes are needed, 1 optional:</p> <p>1 - Change the 21 day prehire code to 45.</p> <p>2 - Add a driver GCV containing all additional job codes (swaTitleCode) to allow processing to IDtoCSS.</p> <p>3 - Optional: add a ‘wd-merge’ style functionality to the driver to send over both an FANH and 0005 event to CSS.</p> <p>4 - (new) 1/22/2024 11:10:11 PM - May need to send an additional 0005 along with every FANH . . note that this probably should be treated as more new requirements and possibly put on a new story; not sure yet.</p> <p>All notes:</p> <p>The IDtoCSS driver has had to separate issues reported from production; though both of them are changes needed due to changes made on their side, where the driver simply wasn’t written to support. The two changes needed are:</p> <ol> <li>There is a ‘FutureSync’ work order that gets created 21 days before swaExpectiveHireDate. We need to change the number to 45 as they had expected people to be onboarded earlier.</li> <li>We need to add a GCV list item that can take a list of job codes (swaTitleCode) that are allowed into CSS. The current list is this. I believe FA01 and FA99 are already allowed; however, we should put the remaining items in the GCV list, and allow them to be processed by the driver. At this point, the most direct update to the driver, would be to check the GCV list at the bottom of the “sub-ets-FilterEvents” policy, and setting the lv_Valid_Crew_Member variable to ‘TRUE’ so the driver doesn’t veto them: <ol> <li>FA01 Flight Attendant<br/> FABL Bilingual Flight Attendant<br/> SU61 Supv Flight Attendants<br/> 871B Supv Bilingual Flight Attendants<br/> FA99 Flight Attendant Training<br/> 678A Learning Program Manager</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>Initial notes:</p> <p>Today in our CSS meeting there were a total of 16 users that didn't get sent to CSS and they were going to start training and needed to be there. Here are some items we discussed and learned:</p> <p>Short term findings and updates needed:</p> <ul> <li>For the class that starts today, 16 users had to be pushed through the driver. To do this, there are two steps:</li> </ul> <ul class="alternate" type="square"> <li>Set swaExpectiveHire date set to today (to avoid a future date hire workorder)</li> <li>Push the user through the driver (#4# operation, and delete the association value to get an FANH)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>There were two issues discovered: <ul> <li>1 - The early processing of user hires was set to 21 days; but it turns out this date needs to be closer to 30 or 40.</li> <li>2 - Some users, called 'supervisors' had a swaTitleCode of SU61, and are not currently processed by the driver; 4 users fell into this category; and they'll need to fix it on their side, as we can't resolve without updating the driver.</li> </ul> </li> <li>This issue is likely going to happen again on Tuesday, Jan 23 on the next class!</li> </ul> <p>Next actions:</p> <ul> <li>Trent Rutherford is going to put together a meeting including the following to document the new requirements:<br/> Trent Rutherford<br/> Aaron Kynaston<br/> Eric Maras<br/> Fred Carlson<br/> Possibly Morgan Braun</li> <li>We also need to chat before Tuesday Jan 23 as this issue will likely happen again for the same reasons. <ul> <li>We will need to locate users that should be in the system, and manually push them as described above.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Long term next actions:</p> <ul> <li>We'll need to record the new requirements from Trent's meeting in the MCL driver page here: <a href="https://southwest.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CYSEC/pages/74551212/MCL" title="smart-link" class="external-link" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://southwest.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CYSEC/pages/74551212/MCL</a></li> <li>We'll need to manually fix users that fall into this category as long as these classes are going on until we can update the driver to take these new requirements.</li> </ul> </description>

This means users can be onboarded 45 days before their swaExpectiveHIredate assuming they meet other title/unioncode requirements. They simply need people in the system sooner than they thought from what it sounded like.</p> <p>2 - The second part is that the users that fall into ‘supervisor’ or ‘training’ categories all need to be allowed into CSS; but these might be tricky to identify. I have an ongoing chat with Jean Stepehns about the definition; then we’ll have a clear path foward I am hoping.</p></comment>

I think we’ve nailed them down to at least a set of 6; but the target audience for this class seems to be pretty vague when talking with the team; but I think if we were to write the driver to also accept users with these swaTitleCodes in a configurable GCV, then we’d be in a good position. FA01, Fa99 are already taken care of . .but the others have not been added to the driver yet; hence this story.</p> <p>FA01 Flight Attendant<br/> FABL Bilingual Flight Attendant<br/> SU61 Supv Flight Attendants<br/> 871B Supv Bilingual Flight Attendants<br/> FA99 Flight Attendant Training<br/> 678A Learning Program Manager</p></comment>

The CSS team seems to need these for initial creates of a user.</li> <li>to send a 0005/0002, just use #4# without deleting the association value portion; this sends a larger payload that includes emergency contact and passport information.</li> <li>Since the driver does not process users with a job code (swaTitleCode) of SU61 and others mentioned in comments here; the process of getting supervisors into CSS is going to be manual until we can make these driver updates.</li> </ul> </comment>

They have been expecting them to be in place earlier than they are now.</p> <p>2 - Add a GCV that allows additional job codes through. So far that is this list. Some job codes like fa01 and fa99 are arleady included, and don’t need to be in the GCV. This will let us add additional job codes on the fly if needed; but I’d like to get it as static as possible; so we’ll start with this list:</p> <p>FA01 Flight Attendant<br/> FABL Bilingual Flight Attendant<br/> SU61 Supv Flight Attendants<br/> 871B Supv Bilingual Flight Attendants<br/> FA99 Flight Attendant Training<br/> 678A Learning Program Manager</p> <p>3 - (Optional) We may want to add a ‘trigger’ attribute of some sort (like setting ‘description’ to ‘sendme’ . or like a wd-merge) that can cause both an FANH and 0005/0002 event to go to CSS: We’ve had to manually do this a few times; and having this capability would save us some resolution time.</p></comment>
