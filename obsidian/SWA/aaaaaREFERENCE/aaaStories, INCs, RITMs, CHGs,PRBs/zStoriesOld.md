Altea Drivers | IDM - Finalize Prod Deployment

There is a set of random items that need to be closed up before we can do the deploy.
   - Schedule CR - Maybe Jan 23rd? (24/25 are freeze)
   - Email Joe, Jack, Robert about Altea cronjobs that they need to stay in place.
   - Test initial migration import in QA, and just retreival and creation in PROD.
   - Update biuld to write driver logs configured in a way to enable ping authentication testing without causing issues for Ops.
   - Add POST IMP task to notify core and ops about the new drivers; first for disabled drivers, then when they go live.
   - Add a note somewhere to track the removal/deletion of the old driver and associations.
   - Finish build url config for IDtoAltea for prod (and lower envs to automate build)
   - Research: Postman: confirm ping authentication works in prod, through postman (get cyberark password for ping auth)
   - Optional: AC: document step for Ops to retreive signIDs if missing swaAlteaSignIDs in prod: can't retreive through API.
   - Email from Logan on the UAT - What is a WSAP in production? And we should probably update him on our production deploy time oafter the training today.
   - POST GOLIVE: Add this to consider later: "User ID already allocated to one sign of this office." - can't get signid . .brainstorm.
   - Optional: IDToAlteaSignDB: swaAlteaSignIDs: write test for notify->sync change; and update filter.

 I created 1839 - the session 2 for UAT; but we need to complete 1838 before 1839. This is AvioBook, so I think may be next sprint:
 https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSCE-1838 (do first - this is the documentation/AC story)
 https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSCE-1839 (this is the second UAT story)

Stories


IDtoAvioBooks: AC update: latest conditions for provisioning
Assignee: Aaron
External dependency? Yes: I need to speak probably with Nadar, and others that may have the requirements.
ENVs: DEV/QA/PROD
EPIC: this just needs to be assigned as the next action on the AvioBooks driver; probably immediately after MCL
Is 1 Story needed for each environment: No, the definition just needs to be created and documented once.
Iteration: Probably the iteration that starts while we're on site, the week of Jan 15.
Description: The IDtoAvioBooks driver conditions for provisioning as described here: https://southwest.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CYSEC/pages/74553541/IDtoAvioBooks, have recently changed per Nadar. We are in a position where we need to get a super clear path forward on what provisioning conditions are.

Right now, there are to main categories of conditions:
1 - MyAccess: Manual assignemnt of roles (direct NOC role assignment through MyAccess is blocked)
2 - Combination of attributes, swaStatus, swaTitle, swaDeptCode.
   - Note that 6 sets of job codes correspond to one of 6 NOC roles; which are assigned only through these special job codes. See the AC above for details.



Acceptance Criteria: When completed, a paccount created in IDV without a swaRequestID

If there are separate stories, can they bean in the SAME sprint: Yes

Iteration: High priority from CSEE; though I don't know how it compares to current work.

Description: The IDtoLDAP driver should not require swaRequestID.

Acceptance Criteria: When completed, a paccount created in IDV without a swaRequestID

Farhan, here are the QA and prod stories that are based on CSEE-3671 to do the promotion to these environments. I should probably have these stories in the next sprint since I've got a lot already commited; though I'll jump on it when I can:

Farhan, Here are the new stories for the IDtoAvioBook driver.  The top three are the standard driver stories.  The last one is a MyAccess story for the roles that are meant to come from there. . .I have no business creating MyAccess stories; so I don't know if it's useful or not; but wanted a place holder at least.

Updates to miro following call; sent to Farhan and Brad just now 5/15/2024 1:45:26 PM


Farhan, I've created the following stories due to my IDtoMiro call. We've identified the following work. I have given a description, and AC and points to each story, I suspect the scheduling and epic among other things needs to be fixed. I haveÂ  requested a priority from them; but for now am loosely targeting the end of next PI:
