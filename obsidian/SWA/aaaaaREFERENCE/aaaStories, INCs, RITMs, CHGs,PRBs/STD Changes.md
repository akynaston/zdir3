Update from John Mapes - further concern:
5/22/2024 2:32:02 PM
STD change: risk:
 - Not wide changes
 - Risk assessment would need to be looked at again . .
 - Current devops model outpacing our chagne process . .'
 - note: everbridge/mcl: change model big pain
 - dept code update from workday:
 - Training: yearly thing maybe? Maybe every 2? . .referesher . .
 - concern: easier changes sometimes = lack of testing.
 - remediation:
   - gitlab tier 4: for remdiation
   - Tier 4: cannot be used as remediation for anything, teir 0-3
   - In DR hiearchy, apps are tiered
   - routers/switches: tier 0: required for everything
   - IDM: tier 1 . .
   - Can deploy with lower tier, not aaiable for DR ..
   - Can speak with archictect on this . .
   - HOw can we make gitlab able to do DR?
     - Archetecture team!!
     - pipelines for DR: Ansible . .
     - Was an onprem solution with higher tier . .
     - Puja/Jim Halsema .
     - tier 4/tier 5 idm driver: just fine . .
