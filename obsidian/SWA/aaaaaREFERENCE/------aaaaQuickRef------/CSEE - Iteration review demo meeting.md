Notes from Yvonne about demos for the team:

** Please note changes to presenters and new presenters added **

This is our Iteration Review and Demo meeting.  The purpose of the iteration review is to **measure the team’s progress** by showing working stories to the Product Owner and team to elicit feedback.  Please come prepared to demonstrate any completed, functional pieces of code, software, or applications you have not demoed since the last Iteration Review and Demo meeting.

We may also use this time to share information across the team in a mini cross training initiative. 

If it is your month to present, please join the Review prepared to share some information with the team about the technologies you support.  This could be in the form of a demonstration of functional code developed since our previous Review and Demo, a tutorial or demo of the technology, or something else of interest to the team.  Please plan for 10 - 20 minutes plus time for questions.
