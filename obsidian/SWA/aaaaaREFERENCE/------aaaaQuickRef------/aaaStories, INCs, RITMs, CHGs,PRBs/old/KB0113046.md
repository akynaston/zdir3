**INTRODUCTION**

The WorkdayHCM driver needs to be able to rename accounts always to match their username, which is then reflected in the wd-UserName attribute.

**Estimated Completion Time:**  15 minutes

**Requirements:**  Access to the server command line running the WorkdayHCM driver, and the DXCMD tool on that server.

**Intended Audience:** Cybersecurity Engineering Operations, then an IDM engineer; such as IGA Core, or EE.

**Instructions:**

There are times when a username mismatches some data in Workday. In these cases, the username needs to be updated in workday to even allow admins to edit the user.  To resolve this do the following:

 * Authenticate to the server running the WorkdayHCM driver.  
 * Create an XML file such as the one that follows; with the proper data: *   
     * Note: I suspect that in all cases, the new-name value should always match the cn value at the end of the src-dn.  
 ```  
 <nds dtdversion="4.0" ndsversion="8.x">  
  <source>  
    <product edition="Advanced" version="4.8.6.0000">DirXML</product>  
    <contact>NetIQ Corporation</contact>  
  </source>  
  <input>  
    <rename class-name="User" dest-dn="Employee_ID-44517" src-dn="swaiddev\Users\e44517">  
      <association>Employee_ID-44517</association>  
      <new-name>e44517</new-name>  
    </rename>  
  </input>  
</nds>  
```  
* Be sure to update the DN and the new-name fields with the proper values.  
* Submit the event to the driver on the subscriber channel using DXCMD.
