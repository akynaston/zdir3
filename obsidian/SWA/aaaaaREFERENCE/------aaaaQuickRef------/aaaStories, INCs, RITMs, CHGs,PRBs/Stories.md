Story fix sent to Farhan just now

I had a quick upate for you: I determined that I had created some avio book stories; but they were attached to the docunet epic, so I think they were lost in the shuffle. I'll go ahead and consolidate all the work we have defined from my stories into the new one; unless you say otherwise:

Here's my plan

Context:
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-3759 - IDtoAvioBook | IDM | Add Cabin and TechLog roles
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-3762 - IDtoAvioBook | MyAccess | Add Cabin and TechLog roles

Actions:
3759 - I am going to close/decline/archive this story and move to the actual 3778 story currently in my todo list.
3762 - I am going to close/decline/archive this story and move to the actual 3778 story currently in my todo list.

IDtoAvioBook | IDM - Pipeline Deploy Configuration - needed to add pipeline for odd two drivers.
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-3913



7/23/2024 1:30:57 PM
Farhan, I realized I needed a new QA deploy story, since the prelive driver came in; so I cloned the previous QA deploy story we completed recently to this:

Aviobook - Flight & Cabin | IDM - QA Deploy (Cabin/Flight/prelive)
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-3920

I also renamed the ALREADY EXISTING prod story to include the 'prelive' portion, and match the prod version:
Aviobook - Flight & Cabin | IDM - Prod Deploy (Cabin/Flight/prelive)
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-3784


8/2/2024 9:57:25 AM

Aviobook - Flight & Cabin | IDM - QA (Cabin/Flight/prelive) UAT
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-3931
 - This story will cover the UAT work Nader + team and I will complete hopefully on Monday, Aug 5. This driver is super visible, so we'll need to spend some time on this.


Aviobook - Flight & Cabin | IDM -  (Cabin/Flight/prelive) Put/Post Issue resolution
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-3932
* This story covers a possible issue with the driver sending an HTTP POST operation when a Put should have been used per the API documentation. . . I am still trying to reproduce the issue and write a test for the situation.

Farhan, I've created two new stories to complete some items with Yatin on the Sprinkler driver. We'll likely be adding a training story for IDM folks on how to use the latest pipelines; but that's a bit less defined right now; so we'll get it done when we can.

Farhan, FYI: I just created this: it's the next most important think after IDtoSprinkler.  I'll close up IDtoSprinkler tasks after having a sync up with Yatin on Monday.

I am not adding this to the sprint until/unless you ask me to; though it is my current work:

Team,

Per Logini's latest request, here are the items that require stories. The stopping and starting of the driver during their migration does not require a story. 

Here are some additional stories to cover the move of the QA employee service driver to EMPUAT1, then later, we'll need to move it back to FC3:

IDtoEmployeeSvc | IDM | Monitor New Error Manager: Prep for Ops KT Session
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-4778
Story points 3 - level of effort on this is a little higher, as we're trying to collect any errors that are infinte retries.

Iâve spent a bit of time on this, and wanted to document why. The summary is that having three drivers to manage this work is quite a bit more work than a single driver. Also, the Carepicture driver uses a different API and more complicated credentials . .Details:

Iâve been finding that the authentication config for the three EmployeeSvc drivers is more complicated than previously thought. Over the last week or so, we were asked to stop using FC3 as they were doing work there and wanted all the latest stuff in EMPUAT1. it turns out that for the SOAP API, there is a username and password, the REST API uses the username, password, client ID and client secret. For this reason, we have quite a bit more than the normal amount of password management for drivers; summary:

Environments:

**EMPDEV1**: weâve been given roles/profiles, and authentication info to use this environment again.

**EMPUAT1**: weâve been requested to move the three drivers to this environment during the recent updates.

**Prod**: no change.

Drivers: I had assumed it was an option to use FC3 for both IDtoEmployeeSvc and IToEmployeCarePicture for both drivers just to enable development; but this has been resolved:

**IDtoEmployeeSvc**: had to move from FC3 to EMPUAT1 in QA, and had to move from FC3 to EMPDEV1 in DEV.

**EmployeeServicesRoleMgmtDriver**: Had to update 4 base roles from FC3 to EMPUAT1 in DEV; also had build issue to resolve.

**IDtoEmployeeCarePicture**: had to move from FC3 to EMPUAT1 in QA, and had to move from FC3 to EMPDEV1 in DEV; also, this driver uses the REST API, so we had to have a username/password/clientid/client password.

AWS: All of the credentials have to be updated in AWS; updated in the tree for DEV, QA,, and then have all tests pass. SO - this is why this task is taking a while!!

Hola :-) I've created a new story to resolve at least one entitlement policy:

Aviobook - ReorgFix| IDM -  Update roles not affected by reorg
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-4835


I've repurposed these stories to also include the reorg fixes along with the avio_cabin_fa items:

Aviobook - Flight & Cabin | IDM -  Deploy avio_cabin_fa/reorg role fixes to QA
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-4831

Aviobook - Flight & Cabin | IDM -  Deploy avio_cabin_fa/reorg role fixes to Prod

FYI: another good example of something that just came up: While confirming some Aviobook updates in the near future, they requested another update -> 3 stories. It's a small update; but it's using a new table I built in the previous release; so I'd like to test it fully:Â 

Aviobook | IDM -Â  Update pilot qualifications  
[https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-4838](https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-4838 "https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/csee-4838")

**CANCELED** - ALREADY HAVE STORIES ABOVE
Aviobook | IDM -Â  Update pilot qualifications - Deploy QA  
[https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-4839](https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-4839 "https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/csee-4839")

**CANCELED** - ALREADY HAVE STORIES ABOVE
Aviobook | IDM -Â  Update pilot qualifications - Deploy Prod  
[https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-4840](https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-4840 "https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/csee-4840")Â This is a small simple update; and I am already creating CRs for a related component on this driver; so figured I'd add them and do it now.Â Without Miro on my plate, I think I can do this.

Ben,

FYI: I renamed this story to include the 'new role definitions', and attached a spreadsheet with the data - just so it's not a surprise when you see it next:

Aviobook | IDM -  Update pilot Definition to Match Pilot_D, add new role definitions 
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-5028
Points are now 3 (was 2).

Ben - FYI: new story: this is part 2, we had an initial discussion; but this will be reviewing the actual email messages, and resolving issues.

Also, Docunet has asked for a full push of all employees and Contractors. I'd like Ops to do this, so this story will be helping them do this:

Sent to Angie, Ben, Brad, Dhivya, Yvonne
Aaron Kynaston (Contractor) added Ben Cundy and 3 others to the chat.Â 

When I create stories, I'll send to this group, unless/until we setup a single contact here:

Points 3
This is one of our known issues without a fix; I believe I have one now and didn't want to lose the todo item; just putting in the backlog for now.

Guys, here are two new stories for work that has finally been made clear and can be done now. Â I'd like to chat with you to decide how much and what items you'd like me to complete before my OOO starting July 11. Â These two stores in my mind are the top priority; and I think I should shoot to complete both by EOB on Thursday the 10th:

Documented issue in docuware - some data isn't fitting in a column . .
Guys,
FYI: I created a research story for an issue in IDtoDocuware I heard from Ops; all the info is here. The Parent of the story is NOT correct . . I don't know where we'd put this . .maybe in a 'unexpected fixes needed' parent? Not sure - either way here's the story with all the details:
[https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-5259](https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-5259)
I plan on spending probably another 15 minutes determining what the actual issue is, and determine the path forward.Â  This would likely be good work for Nirosha if the EmployeeSvc stuff is too difficult to pass on btw . .
