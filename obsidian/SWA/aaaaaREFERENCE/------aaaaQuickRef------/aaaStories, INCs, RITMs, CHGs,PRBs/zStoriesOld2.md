Story fix sent to Farhan just now

I had a quick upate for you: I determined that I had created some avio book stories; but they were attached to the docunet epic, so I think they were lost in the shuffle. I'll go ahead and consolidate all the work we have defined from my stories into the new one; unless you say otherwise:

Here's my plan

Context:
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-3759 - IDtoAvioBook | IDM | Add Cabin and TechLog roles
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-3762 - IDtoAvioBook | MyAccess | Add Cabin and TechLog roles

Actions:
3759 - I am going to close/decline/archive this story and move to the actual 3778 story currently in my todo list.
3762 - I am going to close/decline/archive this story and move to the actual 3778 story currently in my todo list.

IDtoAvioBook | IDM - Pipeline Deploy Configuration - needed to add pipeline for odd two drivers.
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-3913



7/23/2024 1:30:57 PM
Farhan, I realized I needed a new QA deploy story, since the prelive driver came in; so I cloned the previous QA deploy story we completed recently to this:

Aviobook - Flight & Cabin | IDM - QA Deploy (Cabin/Flight/prelive)
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-3920

I also renamed the ALREADY EXISTING prod story to include the 'prelive' portion, and match the prod version:
Aviobook - Flight & Cabin | IDM - Prod Deploy (Cabin/Flight/prelive)
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-3784


8/2/2024 9:57:25 AM

Aviobook - Flight & Cabin | IDM - QA (Cabin/Flight/prelive) UAT
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-3931
 - This story will cover the UAT work Nader + team and I will complete hopefully on Monday, Aug 5. This driver is super visible, so we'll need to spend some time on this.


Aviobook - Flight & Cabin | IDM -  (Cabin/Flight/prelive) Put/Post Issue resolution
https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CSEE-3932
* This story covers a possible issue with the driver sending an HTTP POST operation when a Put should have been used per the API documentation. . . I am still trying to reproduce the issue and write a test for the situation.

Farhan, I've created two new stories to complete some items with Yatin on the Sprinkler driver. We'll likely be adding a training story for IDM folks on how to use the latest pipelines; but that's a bit less defined right now; so we'll get it done when we can.

Farhan, FYI: I just created this: it's the next most important think after IDtoSprinkler.  I'll close up IDtoSprinkler tasks after having a sync up with Yatin on Monday.

I am not adding this to the sprint until/unless you ask me to; though it is my current work:

Farhan, here's my new stories for the bug fixes I'm making today. I don't know if I'll finish in this sprint, so did not assign them yet. I suspect their epic is old too. I only set the description, AC, and points for now.
