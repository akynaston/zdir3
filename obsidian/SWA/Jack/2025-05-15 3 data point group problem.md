Jack:
 - 300 groups: in idv and AD, but had been associated at one time . .
 - we want to link them back up.
 - don't want to delete group in AD, may be using the ObjectSid
 - Group association issue.
  Data point 1: see this why they don't merge.
   Use case:
   - not linked,
   - jill and jane group in EDIR
   - Susie and pam member group AD
   - bidirectional filter should combine all members.
   - if user missing assoc, will goof.
   - If do all of this, and stripping user: somthing not working.
   - data point 2 I need to see: memberlist should be the same . .
 - 3rd task: if not members; and group for 25 years will delte the group.
