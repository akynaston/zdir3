IDM backlog meeting

Farhan, I'm in a weird state - I have 3 drivers that are winding down. I'm about to wrap up IDtoAvioBook, IDtoMiro and MCL.

1 - (no story yet) IDtoAvioBook: see if Nader wants exclusion functionality; otherwise completed here.

2 - CSEE-3797 - IDtoMiro: Beginning QA/Prod deploys, and major deletion of accounts that shouldn't be in miro any more.

3 - MCL: Need to deprovision all users on leave right now.

4 - Backlog:
 - CSEE-2995 and CSEE-2996 - had some plans to go through the latest IDM driver updates. With the new vendor choice coming up, I don't know how valuable it'll be.

5 - I am open to new work, but also have a bunch of lower priority tasks we've collected over the last few months I could submit stories for then work on.
