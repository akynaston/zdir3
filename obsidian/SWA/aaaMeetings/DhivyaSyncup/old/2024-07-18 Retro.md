What we did good:
Had good communication inside and outside of the team regarding IDtoAvioBook; despite not talking enough.

todo better
The IDtoAvioBook team has quite a bit of internal knoweldge, and things that appear obvious to them none of which translates well to an IDM driver. If I had to do this again, I probably would have involved more people sooner, and had multiple design RA (Requirements Assessment meetings), and established a pattern for them to communicate driver changes.
