 - Dhivia chat - 3 items

1 - Good news, that we got the approval from the core team to use this Roles based entitlement, or RBE driver for the Aviobook and Soar driver. The solution seems to work well as long as you already know how to use it; so we will get it documented.
	- Noted.

2 - Need advice on how to prioritize PRBs and INCs. In our team we haven't really had a mechanism for cadence meetings on PRBs until now; I think Melissa Martin and Carmen Alvarez have a meeting; but I think it keeps getting pushed; we haven't actually started the cadence meetings yet.
	 - If people are impacted, resolve now.
	 - How bad is it? what is the impact? 
	 - Get scheduled into PI ASAP . .
	 - PRB's are less 'right now': normally describe a pattern that can be planed into an PI
	 - INCs are things happening right now, and we'll review . .
	 -  Can set due target date on INC/PRB  to help communicate . .
	 
3 - I have been noticing that my laptop has always had an odd slowness to it - it seems like Carbon Black, our end point protection software seems to be going haywire over the last few months. There's another gathering tool that seems to also capture how the network is being used; which I think is the admin desktop usage tool
	 - The machine I have seems relatively solid when it isn't being hammered by these two apps - I can just deal with it if need but, if I'd like to chat with those teams and do some disk checks to see if my laptop behaves better if we can more intellighty apply it - for example, every IDM person uses Designer,a nd it is extremely file heavy and is severely slowed by Carbon Black; if ther'es a way to either exclude, or maybe pre-check all the files I think it would be super helpful to speed things up.
	 - John Burks owns Carbon black.
