  - Sent thx for Gokul to Dhivya
    Dhivya, I wanted to send a quick note for Gokul: he has been awesome: He's been really pushing for keeping things done clean and by the book; despite having some complicated IDM driver work, and supporting Nirosha on some SCIM stuff we're all new too. I've appreciated his work, and have been able to do my job easier because of him. Thanks!

  - Workday self identification?
