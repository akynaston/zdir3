2 truths and a lie:
 1. I have been sky diving twice.
 2. I lived in Colombia, South America for more than a year.
 3. I have been on a 100 mile bike ride.

Extra credit: I can eat an entire bag of Doritos by myself. I will not confirm if this is a truth or a lie, this is provided only as an initial prompt for introspection ;-)
