Creating my own stories + Farhan organizing & prioritizing.


I commited to too much this sprint; didn't account for so much UFM learning. Other than knowing what I didn't know, I don't think I could have done this differently. My IdtoDocunet's use of UFM is a rare case scenario, and UFM is one <italian accent>spicy meatball</italian accent>.

How I feel about UFM:

UFM: stores private keys and passphrases, and does some cyberark work for you which is cool, but just setting up a new setup seems a bit step heavy: For example the fire wall portion could be further backed into the process since its already known that the gateway will need access to a new server.

Revisit the value that UFM is bringing us & create/locate a training, or find something better. While it nicely integrates with Dash, nicely stores private key/passphrases, and helps with Cyberark configuration it is a multi-day process to set something up requiring lots of teams to take steps to setup a simple file copy. Seems like a process that could be streamlined & updated.



 - I picked up too much this sprint.
