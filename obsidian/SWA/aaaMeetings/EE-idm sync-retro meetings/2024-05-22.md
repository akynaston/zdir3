IDM sync up meeting
Mostly just Nirosha,a nd Gokul, now MIke talking.



My thoughts:
lots of little random changes
   - Duto code cyange in altea, qa/prod deploy
   - bug in the doucnet driver along with a q/prod eploy
   -


 - So I need to do a QA and Prod deploy for the two drivers; and woud have loved to have the standard chagne ready to go.
  - standard change wasn't in approval state, so will need to finalize on Friday
 - Have a minor fix for the IDtoDocunet driver that is complete now
 - Have the Duty code update for altea
 - Had my Miro meeting with the app owner and support team: We need to clean out some users, and it may be a little messy to get the job done.
   - I'll be submitting probably 4 stories to finish this.
