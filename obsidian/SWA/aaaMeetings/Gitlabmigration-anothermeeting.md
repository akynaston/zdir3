Gitlab Q&A session
Joey Khashab seems to be running meeting
Pooja Sijapati - setting this up; doing recording.
 - gitlab - SAAS

 - eliminte upgrade/maintenance
 - eliminates vits
 - premimum to ultimate!
 - gitlab training & certs


Question: I'm curious if the per project settings such as merge rules.
   - Also - will projects bea ble to inherit from parent folders? For example, can I set merge rules on a higher folder, then have all new repos created in that project inherit rules?

old gitlab ends the end of this year!
