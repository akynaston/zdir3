 - IDtoDocunet
  Prod issue: 1258 files hadn't been pushed
   - Just spoke with Cihichi Pearson - I know her well from resolving stuff in the past, and she gave some good feedback; but I need to make a decision, and I like to bring it up with you so you know what I"m choosing and why.
   - I think the monitoring I'm setting up is pretty rare; so was hoping to make it super clear to everyone involved.

FYI   - I'm moniritng /opt/UFM/bin/alerts.log - sending INCs whenever files don't send properly.



 - IDtoMiro Teams
     - Dash
       - short oneone one . . .
     - MyAccess
       - ping MIke/Manoj . .
     - Driver
     - 268 - groups/teams - want to expose > 20 members

Summary:
Here's a quick summary of our chat:

 - IDtoDocunet: I'll submit a RITM to the 'Enterprise Monitoring team' following the alerts.log path from https://southwest.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/APIGW/pages/101253650/UFM+-+Monitoring.
 - IDtoMiro: I need a chat Dash and MyAccess folks to make decisions about how to manage teams.
   - An initial chat with just me and a dash engineer may be valuable - I'll start with Jonathan Bledsoe.
   - Another initial chat with just me and Mike and/or Manoj would be good; I"ll ping Mike.
