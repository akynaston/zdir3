Ok - status report for week ending 8/22:

Yvonne,



Here's our weekly status report:



MyAccess:
  - Mike is XXXXX% complete with the MyAccess Apptio-Frontdoor work.
  - Mike is 0% complete with the MyAccess Apptio-TargetProcess work.
  - Mike has created the defaultRole collectors for main and cloudability.
  - Next: he'll create the custom role collectors.




Driver IDtoApptioFrontDoor: Driver is 95% code complete. I still need to:
 ┬á - 1 Do end-to-end testng with Mike to see his code write to the 4 attrs correctly, then have my driver fullfill it properly, then do a collectoin to see the full round trip.
 ┬á - 2 Need to add the 'Sync' functionality



Driver IDtoApptioTargetProcess: Driver is 0% complete, likely will start tomorrow.
