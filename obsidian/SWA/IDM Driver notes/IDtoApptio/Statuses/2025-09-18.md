Status report for week ending 9-18

Yvonne,

Here's our weekly status report. In short, the project is now on hold - there will be no change to this status until we're asked to work on Apptio again.


MyAccess: no change; many MyAccess projects have been moving forward; and this project has been deprioritized per the app owner's request due to a role complexity issue.

IDtoApptioFrontDoor/IDtoApptioTargetProcess drivers: both complete, need MyAccess integration testing. The Initial migration tool for TargetProcess has been completed. The Initial migration tool for FrontDoor has not been started. I was asked to move to the EmployeeSvc drivers instead.
