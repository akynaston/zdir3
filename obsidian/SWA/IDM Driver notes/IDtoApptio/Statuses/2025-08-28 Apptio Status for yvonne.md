Ok - status report for week ending 8/29:
Yvonne,

Here's our weekly status report:

MyAccess:
  - Mike is working on the MyAccess work for Apptio & TargetProcess.
  - He's had many projects to fix and resolve in QA & production as you know.
  

Driver IDtoApptioFrontDoor: Driver is code complete. I still need to do the end to end testing with Mike, but the payload is pretty simple and I'm feeling confident with what we've done.

Driver IDtoApptioTargetProcess: Driver is 5% complete. Authentication is somewhat nonstandard again, and I've had to fight the URLS; but I am moving forward.
