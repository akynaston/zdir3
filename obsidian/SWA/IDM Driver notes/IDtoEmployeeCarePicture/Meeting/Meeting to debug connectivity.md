   - 8/28 - changes - reset password, caused an outage.
   - Sai was part of the tasks
    - during release date, sales force
   - Yatin helped out with some salesforce credentials.

 - Sai discussing thoughts - they had to recreate passwords as idm team didn't have password.
 - Loginini - saying we have an 8 pm prod update now . . and working to resolve concerns.
 - Sai: we had to reset the password
 - 7:30 8/28 - invalid password log from Loginini
 - Loginini - lots of people can reset passwords now.
 - Nirosha - Nirosha developed the driver
   - two drivers: IDtoEmployeeCarePicture, and EmployeeSvc driver
   - Both drivers use the same credentials and log info.
   - When this password, Yatin may have just updated one driver.
   - this may be why on 8/28, we still had one driver failing.
   - 9/17/2024 2:03:02 PM - looks like ruben was able to get the IDToempoyeeCarepicture started.
