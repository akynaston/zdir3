 - Brandon issue:
 - e32607 -
   - has two apparent valid correct sign ids
   - suplemental one didn't get applied
   - path forward:
     - Delete 2024-06-07 date
     - reprocess user
       - delete both suplementals
       - just 2024-08-05 one back . .
       - See wha tIDtoAltea does . .

TODO:
 - IDToAltea - e32607 fix:
   - copy 805 value -
   - Just delete both suppl ids . .
   - then put back the 805 just like myaccess
   - Deletes will cleanup database (desirable)
   -
