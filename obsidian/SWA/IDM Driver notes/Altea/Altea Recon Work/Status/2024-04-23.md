Altea recon report:

 - Created to try and show issues that may need to be resolved.

Details:
 - Input: Export from Altea from Brandon: has all users, their corresponding office IDs, and signIDs.
 - Output: list of all situations where there seemed to be a mismatch between Brandons file, and either eDirectory, or the SQL databases, or both.


TODO:
   - need new meeting with altea matching data to current edir/sql . .
   - Weekly check in?
   - Dakota: option to have driver re-asses?
     - Joe: Concern: supplementals would be removed . . also may have XX+XY+XZ multiples per user issue . .
   - e118639 in prod review:
     - swaTitleCode: AL22
     - swaDeptCode: 19
     - swaLoaction: HDQ
     - Brandon: no RBAC: doesn't correspond to office id . .
     1CP shouldn't be assigned . . .educated guess.


* TODO   - Define scenario 1: mismatching swaAlteaOfficeID must appear at least once in swaAlteaSignID.
   - Brandon/Dakota: prod file: Maybe have Dakota do it regularly?
   - Aaron: Re-run of the report
   - minimize time drift . .
   - Duty code discussion?? Yes possible: old driver did not do this . .this is in another process . .
     - Maybe AIS . .java code did this?
     - Mickias: meeting on April 26 - to confirm duty code setting idtoaltea create user . .
     - need to set duty code every time an office id is set: hardcode to SU? default others use G.+ . .we want SU.
     - change default? can update current user . . can't seem to change default value in altea.
   - Altea access discussion:
     - every app communciates through AIS: single platform through this, it's middleware: seamless ais communciation.
     - drivers had to chagne, ais was on prem; they moved to cloud to tlak to cloud version
     - SQL database our drivers talk to isn't altea sql; it's SWA for auditing purposes.
