Issue with 'final/DEV/idtodocunet.xml' file not found: [12:37 PM] Aaron Kynaston (Contractor)

[https://gitlab-tools.swacorp.com/csiam/idm/idtodocunet/-/jobs/137680968](https://gitlab-tools.swacorp.com/csiam/idm/idtodocunet/-/jobs/137680968 "https://gitlab-tools.swacorp.com/csiam/idm/idtodocunet/-/jobs/137680968")

Then ran from command line; and get 'Set' class - like a 'Driver Set' unquoted space?

Then did gradlew -m below, to list next tasks: issue with compilejava?

latest - has job compare

Also - note alpha prep: driver doesn't exist there; I think we determined the deployer doesn't support new drivers (yet)

Next - idm deploy issues:
 - https://gitlab-tools.swacorp.com/csiam/idm/idtodocunet/-/jobs/137733563
 - lots of 'different stuff' but no green/red . .may need to see line ending/space differences?
 - Job wasn't seen in export . .may missed a spot to disable job compare/deploy boolean.
