 - SWAFileHandler: I'd like to standardize on unique INFO-XXX and ERROR-XXX values for failures to write files . .ones that could be used across any driver, and are not likely to be used - maybe:
        (SFH = SWAFileHandler)
         - INFO-SFH-001 - success
         - ERROR-SFH-002 - Error: aong with error message.
