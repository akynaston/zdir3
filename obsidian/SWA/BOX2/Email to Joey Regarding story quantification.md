  
Joey, 

  

Here is the list of people that would make sense to be a part of that points and workload conversation . . maybe a subset of these would be ideal.  Gary, could you review my write-up below and see if you agree? Feel free to add any insight you have.

  
  
Stephanie.Smith@wnco.com  
Farhan.Raman@wnco.com  
Ben.Cundy@wnco.com  
Dhivya.Balasubramanian@wnco.com  
Joe.Gividen@wnco.com  
Yatin.Dodia@wnco.com  
  
Stephanie - Project Owner/Story PM of the CE team, the one I"m on . . .I think Gary is too.  
Dhivya - I believe is the manager of the CE team - she's smart and has some strong opinions on this sort of stuff.  
Farhan and Ben seem to be in a similar role; possibly one level higher than Stephanie and Dhivya  
Joe and Yatin are the 'tech leads' that took over for Colton . . they may be good to keep up to date at a minimum, especially if we want to change the way we quantify work.
