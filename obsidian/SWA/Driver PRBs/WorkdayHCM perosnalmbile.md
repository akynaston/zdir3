88697: personal mobile on the user in workday:
![[Pasted image 20240313175615.png]]


We found that the user's homephonenumber was in the trace; but that we set it by policy: the current working theory, is that since we fully set personalMobile in the filter as a mergeauth for app, we shouldn't ahve it this way; since that just removes it from the event as a remove-all-values.
