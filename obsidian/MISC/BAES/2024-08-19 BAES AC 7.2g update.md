Shaun,

Ok, cool; I should be able to do that now as SWA has cooled off a little. Here is what I am doing now:

I will make two updates to this AC:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1heXxCXWVDVwe-kvHipqHbEkquWm3NX7x/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=107332529189925699899&rtpof=true&sd=true

1 - I'll update section "2.5.15 baeIsUserComplete" as needed to describe the creation of a new attribute, baeIncompleteUserReason which will be a human-readable set of sentences describing why a user is incomplete, or that it will be cleared if/when they become complete.

2 - I'll update section "1.4 LMS" with a note to describe a "pre-processing stage" that will escape the &quot; characters so that the resulting JSON is correctly formatted.

Also, one more question: is it just the &quot; values we want to remove? Could they have others? When we make the change, we can create an itemized list of strings GCV for all the values we want to strip from the input data.
