 1.2.2.3.3
 - Why 5 days?
   - This is what they requested . . HR team works this way . .
   - Adnaan/Martin may know this.

 - Start date should be read then 5 days more in the past
   - this is a bug
 - baelastworkidna of 1899-12-31 shouldb e considered not available.
     (if-op-attr 'baeLastWorkingDay' not-available) = FALSE.
     - OR = 1899-12-31 -

2 minor issues
  2 hours . .

4 - hours total . .

** Must be in office to VPN . .



Issues to fix:
1 - Start date to be checked should be > 5 days in the past; not just before today.
2 - baeLastWorkingDay should be checked against actual blank, and 1899-12-31
optional
1 - 







   - validateDate(attributeValue, 64, 50)
     - 1936 - 1950  . .

Update: I think we're good on time still per your comments Shaun; but just FYI: I need to adjust my estimate from 4 to probably 6 or so. I'm having an odd test bug that I need to get past.

DETAILS:
	I appear to suffer from extreme programmer optimism ;-). I am 2 hours into this. My VM is up-to-date and running tests but haven't yet seen my 1.2.2.3.3 test pass before I start. I've seen the issue before where the emulated SF input docs are nearly empty, and don't remember what we've done to resolve this; working on this now.

Still no news on the tiny-input doc issue above . . like the spreadsheet dodesn't pass all the data some time . .

 Test 1.2.2.3.3
 * Was passing  as written; but not correctly.
 * Added cleanup of test user to main cleanup for SF tests to help re-run test over and over.
 * Test had odd additional step:
* ![[Pasted image 20240628162916.png]]
Why these? . .converst user to congient worker . .?

* Test had a step to put existing lastworking day in the past; not correct, 1.2.2.3.3 shows new pulled 5555 user has the stat date in the past and no working day.
* Test took no lastworking day to mean it was 'blank; but customer was using, 1899-12-31


All done (odd small doc not fixed yet . .not sure why . .)

Shaun,
Update: I'm code complete, I'll be billing about 4.75 hours. I have a few next actions I want to iron out with you when you are free.

 - I have these concerns:
	 - There are MANY code paths on these JML AC items: LOTS of variaitions exist: the entire setup could fail if only one thing is wrong: such as having a start date only 4 days in the past! I am going to assume we are ok with this risk for now; unless you want me to write more tests.
	  - I could use a second pair of eyes if you get a moment so we could confirm my date math is right, when you are free on Monday.

Next actions:
 - I will avoid deploying until we get the go ahead.
 
Fixes made:
	 - Issue 1 - Allowing baeLastWorkingDay = 1899-12-31 to signify blank.
	 - Issue 2 - Checking now - 5 against start date; to ensure it is at least 5 days in the past.
	 - Optional issue 1 - pub-cmd-users: Avoid attempting query of baeLastWorkingDay from CSV.
	 - Optional issue 2 - pub-cmd-users: We won't attempt to convert blank date, because we wont ever get here since issue #1 was fixed.
	 - Also minor updates:
		 - Add classpath to IdMUnit xmlfileconn source to allow debugging.
		 - Fix comment in runVMTestServers.bat to clarify where they should run.
		 - Add 1.2.2.3.3. test user to delete sheet to allow easier system cleanup.
	 - Release 10.5.6 has been built (checked in on svn revision 1508).
