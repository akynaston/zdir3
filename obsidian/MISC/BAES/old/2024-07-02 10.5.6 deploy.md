[BAES] Deploy complete: Successfactors driver update from Release 10.5.6 is now deployed in BAES Test.

Shaun,  
  
I've successfully deployed the SuccessFactors driver, 10.5.6 into the BAES TEST environment, and successfully ran the new IdMUnit match tests in their environment. Note that their Greenlink SSL seems to be misconfigured or is otherwise non-functional. The match tests do not depend on Greenlnk to pass successfully, but they may want to know about this if they don't already. the full release is in the usual spot; see below for a screenshot.

  
Also note, I am still in progress on doing the following:  
 - Archiving my VMs since they work properly now.  
 - The idmunit-config.xml file is a bit different on their server; I'm going to work to diff it back into SVN if I can cleanly, after confirming with Patrick and Carl that I should.

one surprise: the get input files job is disabled in BAES test, is this desirable?
