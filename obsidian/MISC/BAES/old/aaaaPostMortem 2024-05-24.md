 - Regular SVN update has to be done.
 - More regular VM archiving should be done . . we almost need an explicit calendar based reminder . .like a fixed once-a-month reminder that tells us to archive, or explain why we didn't need to archive.
 - My own mistakes:
	 - The solution, while it worked and was as dynamic as we needed it, it ended up with a very difficult to get right setup:
		 - Reduction of repeated code was necessary; but perhaps we solve it in a different way . maybe create an 'IMPORT-ME-FIRST' library so the service driver ordering isn't so complicated.
		 - idMUnit tests: really all need to be passing. .
			 - Maybe add a check to see that all policies are assigned as expected?
