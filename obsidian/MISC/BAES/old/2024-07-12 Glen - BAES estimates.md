BAES - AS (authroaizstion services) should be seprated from IDV
 - VROM - need tog et monety
 - Generous estimates
 - what makes sense: make AS a downstream app . .
 - Put up another edir - put idm in it . .
 - Connect current valut to AS directory
 - *point web app and databse to the new AS directory
 - *LMS driver oints to identivalt with liscenes objects to AS directory . .
 - * need edir driver, bidirectional or legacy - connect idv with AS directory.
 - Most info on users go down - KSA users Kingdom of Sadia Arabia . .
  Example of flitered users:
  - Separate HR & Ad . . that group doesn't particiapte in EC system at all.
  - As we separate from identify valut, no KSA users.
 - Going over AC docs; making determination about what goes to AS and doesnt'
 - Purpose of doing this separation - having identify vault and associate drivers, EC . .
 - Conencting the web app to the AS idv tree ;main idea.
 - Next step: copy of the IDV tree becoming the AS tree.
   - make a copy of IDV for AS purpsoe swith the driver.
   - As we take a closer look during RA (not now) - filter out stuff we don't need.
   - Probably need most of -
 - VROM - about what to excluded . .
 - likely be up to us to do or hel with isntall of edir & idm . .
 - AC - edir to edir what the driver should look like . .
 - Service driver AC - specific functions in AS, rather than having done in IDV
 - How much to service driver in AS? or do it in IDV
