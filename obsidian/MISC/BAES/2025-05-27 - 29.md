Gary & Aaron sync up
 - need to explain ordering to them.
 - If we don't have a GCI number: Can we get the GCI number in another way?
 
 - Gary's thoughts: why not have a clear GCI number . .go get it later . .
 - JDBC connection to database to get the value?
 - All of the rules do their own query . . 
 - *approach: query for all data up front; then just make choices.
 - *Old records coming in??
	e.g.: User in position A . .User + position = GCI . .
	- If User moves into PostionB - positionA enddated, psoition B is started . .
	- But the position A record is still there . .
 - if we do a query up front . . 
	 - we'd have a user and a match where they haven't started yet
	 - 1.2.2.3.2A - gary giving definition . .
	 - why not just allow the match to happen? in the command transform, check the BAEcompanystartdate - veto if it's in the future . .

Shaun,  
  
Gary and I  had an excellent conversation. Gary has done some excellent work by putting together a "truth table" of sorts, and it has made it MUCH easier to talk about and to demonstrate why we did what we did.  Thanks Gary!!  
  
I would like to talk with you on the phone about the requirements when you get a moment. There are two key points we need to talk about: 1 - Why we ordered them the way we did, and 2 - We realized they may have expected the rules to run in a different order (see POSSIBLE UPDATE) below.  
  
  
  
DETAILS:  
  
We think that the next step is to get back with them and present Gary's table to them (and even add it to them matching rule section header); and communicate this:  
  
Key points:  
  
* We have two categories of matching rules: normal-match cases and guess-match cases.  
* After we complete the normal-match cases, which have a logically tighter definition, we get into the guess-match cases.  
* We realized that once we get into the guess match cases, we had to start with the most specific match case so we could avoid undesirable matches, and further decrease the scope of possible matches in a way that would allow for more general cases to follow in a logically acceptable way.  
* **POSSIBLE UPDATE**: It occurred to me that they may see AC's 1.2.2.2, 1.2.2.4, 1.2.2.5, and 1.2.2.6 as 'normal-match cases!! which would mean they'd need to be attempted first! We should discuss this.  
* Otherwise, this was our thinking:  

> * The matching rules are not executed in the order they appear in the AC. The AC ordering was chosen as it was a clean way to talk about a case in one AC, then a branching scenario in the next case.

> * After the initial normal result match cases (yes match, we're done, or no match, we're done type of scenarios), we then need to start working to reduce all possible matches as we get into a 'guessing' scenario on which users should match.
