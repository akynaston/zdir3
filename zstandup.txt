****EE team update items****
 - Notification: we have a workaround for a gitlab problem with using the driver repo for EE folks.
   - short term: we have to reach out to the maintainers to fix the master branch rule.
   - long term: sounds like they're owrking on a fix that would help set our rule properly.
 - Build standards: latest is 2.6.5, don't forget to update!
  You can check your current version by using this method, or just looking for 'standardsVersion' in your build.gradle file:
  C:\work\IDtoAvioBook>grep standardsVersion build.gradle | head -1
    standardsVersion = "2.6.5"

I have a question and two items to cover.

1 - I'd like to chat with you and Dhivya - it sounds like we're tryhing to help with conersion to sailpoint. Assuming this is the case - Gokul and I have some ideas, I"d like to decide how and where we want to store it.

2 - NIrosha and I talked about work she can do over the next to weeks; we may want a quick syncup between the three of us as needed.
   -

3 - ON Apptiotargetprocess driver:
   - 90% competed ewith the documentation
   - I hve one more deprovisioning use case to complete.
   - Then I can create the CRs' and deploy both appto drivers to QA to be ready for testing with Mike.




I've completed the update user functionality, and maybe




LONG STANDING:
Ben and Dhivya - sent a list of the next major items to complete; I have sotires for all items that need them; but I don't know how to show priority in Jira.

1 - IDtoEmployeeSvc: CSEE-4228: Waiting on them to respond to UAT schedule questions (then Prod deploy).
2 - IDtoAutocrib: LAS going live soon; haven't received access to the LAS endpoint yet.
3 - OPS KT sessions (next Thursday, CSEE-5029, CSEE-5038), for Aviobook & EmployeeSvc.
4 - IDtoDocunet: Plan and schedule OPS KT session for Docunet to push all users (may try to combine in meeting above).
5 - IDtoApptio: Driver shell creation, CSEE-4986, and CSEE-4993 are next, deadline July 21 for phase 1

7 - IDtoAviobook: Add the unarchiving feature on rehire, CSEE-5033


=================================
PREVIOUS:
   - Back to documenting the credential rotation. The problem with this work is that we don't really do it for any drivers right now, so I'll need to find a pattern and document it.

Guys,

Here's the status of things for the IDtoApptio project from my side:

IDtoApptio:
   - Gokul KT:
      1 - Just barely started. Gokul has been made aware of this transfer while I'm out from July 11 to the 25th.
      2 - My goal before I leave is to complete the documentation, and a good portion of the swaApptioRoles parsing in the driver if possible.
      3 - We should talk a bit today.

   - MyAccess:
      1 - API collection will likely not be possible as the API can't return the auth token in a response body, unless we choose to go the JSP route, which sounds like it should only be used as a last option. Instead, UFM file transfers will be necessary.
      2 - UFM transfers: I believe we have everything we need . . Ashleigh and team will likely need to build a tool to produce both the initial roles definiton file, and the regular User-> roles file.

   - swaApptioRoles attribute format: Need to work on this; likely with Mike and Chandu. I'll send a suggested pattern to them today (July 3)

   - Initial migration tool: I can build 90% of this, but not the actual LDIF data, as we don't have the swaApptioRoles attribute defined yet; will start this ASAP.



   - Open questions we have at this point: I'll check in with Ashleigh shortly to confirm.
      1 - Confirm a correctly provisioned Targetprocess User requires three things: Frontdoor object, 'Targetprocess User' role, and a PDOS created TargetProcess account.
        Status: Waiting on response form Ashleigh (7/3/2025 8:58:05 AM)
      2 - Do we have a spot to store the EID in an API accessible field in Apptio?
        Status: Waiting on response form Ashleigh (7/3/2025 8:58:05 AM)
