AFCU Issue:

IDM server rebooted, and drivers wouldn't start any more. We found the C:\netiq\common\jre folder had a bunch of files deleted, it only had a total of about 12 files. We found per a backup, that the files appear to have been deleted on September 4th, though we don't know why.




DETAILS:
 - eDirectory server rebooted, and IDM woudln't load any more.
 - ndscons: started 3 or 4 times, didn't load
 - command line - did this typo "ndscons / ?" and it finally worked!
	 - why did that work???
	 - startup of jvm filaed under 'Misc'
	 - Drvrs - shows - 299
 - dstrace.dlm -> showed everything, and found C:\netiq\common\jre has been cleared out sometime around September 4th morning . .
 - Peter Love joined, and started looking into a backup; this is where we got the sep 4 date.
 - They're now working on restoring the files.
 
 
 

Hey guys, thx for checking in. Lately I seem to live completely overwhelmed all the time. Doing simple things seems to be more than I can handle.

git reflog: do watch



Myaccess requires the ability to receive roles, and to receive fullfilment of roles assigned. This has had many roadblocks, and we are investigating three options.

These are roadblocks:
 - Due to a nonstandard FrontDoor API and difficulties with MyAccess using this API, this has taken time to both investigate the posibility of options; but then to see how MyAccess could be configured to operate properly.
 - Another option TBM Studio has internally has X . .
 - Pulling from TBM Studio has a complication of providing a JSON that MyAccess cannot work with natively and would need to be transformed into something MyAccess can use.

What is in a commit ID?
 - message, author time, commit time.
 - Tree of all files in that state 
 - is based on all commits before it:
	 - meaning: it can only exist in its current state exactly as it is now: if anything changes anywhere, git creates new commits.
	 - commits stick around until all references have been removed for somewhere between 30-90 days.

Year to date FTO: 125.25 Hours
Planned FTO: 112 Hours (June 18-20 and July 11 through 25)
Remaining Holidays: 32 Hours (Labor Day, Thanksgiving, the Friday after, and Christmas. Note, Juneteenth, July 4th, and Pioneer Day are captured above in your planned FTO)

Total FTO (Taken and Planned): 269.25

Normalized (you have 12.75 OT hours thus far): 256.5

FTO Balance Available: 63.5 hours (320 minus 256.5)

Note: This does not include any planned time off for the Holiday Break (Dec 26 through 31). That could add another 32 hours, leaving you with 31.5 hours for illness and emergencies for the remainder of the year. 







Hey guys!

I don't think that I've sent the numbers Bob requested this morning; so wanted to send mine out for my FTO:

From Yearly review: 205.25 hours, normalized to 192.5.



As mentioned, I'll be out three days this week startin

Version 1497  May 9 2024 -
	<description>(AC 1.2.2.2)Match on DOB givenName and SN</description>
							Matches between SF data IDV DOB, Given Name, and Surname are supported in order to facilitate rehires where the GCI Number might not match. 

Note: If we found an object (check for @src-dn, then we manually set the association &amp; dest dn).  If that found object also already has an association, we remove it.  This manual 'match' confirmation lets us change the association if the match happens to an account that's already associated.  BAES has assured us that a match on DOB, givenName and SN guarantees uniqueness.

 if we have a match here; we just have GCI changing; so switch the associations now.</comment>

Bob,

I wanted to look at taking some pretty crazy FTO. I know I started out the year kinda rough, but have been able to repair somewhat; and going forward I want to nail this down and make sure I'm in front of FTO related issues.


I have a few questions for you:
1 - We of course want 100% each day & week; would you prefer I end each querter with 100%, or have one be like 98% and another 102%? Maybe it doesn't matter; what is your preference?
2 - I'm planning as if I won't work at all on vacation; but will most likely have time where I can put in good SWA hours while I'm out after I sync up with my team on this, and I'll assume you are good with this until you say otherwise.


DETAILS:

I plan on taking this FTO through the rest of the year
June 18, 19, 20 - 24 hours
July 11 (Friday) - 25th - 11 days, 88 hours

for a total of 112 hours . .which is pretty intense. I've been able to use the FTO calculator, and here are my current + estimated numbers:

Quarter 1: 105% (already over)
Quarter 2: 112% (about half way through
Quarter 3: 102% (Most weeks will need to be a full 40 hours, minus the july time off)
Quarter 4: 100% (Half of the weeks will need to be 40 hours with Christmas and new year off.)

Findings on the BAES remote workstation.

It appears the 10.180.162.39 server, the one we use for our RDP access on the VPN has been completely rebuilt. Here are some findings:

* The server appears to not yet be activated . .not sure if this is a problem . .but thought I'd mention it.
* D:\Remoteloader\Trivir does appear to be our new drop off point for releases.  The previous 10.5.9 is there; though I do not see the 10.5.10 release that I believe Gary may have installed. . .or 10.5.11 . .?
* I copied a new Designer shortcut icon to the desktop, at least on my user: reminder: you must run Designer as Administrator; or you immediately get a useless error instructing you to review a log that doesn't exist.
* D:\RHEL_7.6 does appear to be a working Designer installation, and seems to have our 8 most recent installation workspaces. I did confirm I could successfully do a live compare of the SF driver.
* The other RHEL folders on the drive do exist; though I've left them alone per the note regarding future updates.
* Designer is listed as Version 4.8, Build 20191022

 baes: fix duplciated dve parameters setting in config for succcess factors



11/1/2024 10:56:46 AM
 - INstall communicity edition of the OpenVPN
 - SVN update
 - Confirm tests pass
 - Export any and all drivers, email templates, any other settings that need to be exported and save.
 - Normalize drivers.
 - TortoiseSVN -> right click in BAES/IDM folder, and select commit
 - Unclick all items in the list.
 - Revert items that need reverting
 - Confirm all diffs are as expected.
 - Commit.
 - Update IDM/doc/Release-Notes.txt - following the existing pattern.
 - Update IDM/doc/Deploy Instructions - IDM.txt - following the existing pattern.
 - Open build.xml: change 10.5.8 -> 10.5.9
 - Command line: run 'ant' - the default task will run a new release.
 - Delete the old delivery/BAESIDMDrivers-Release-10.5.8.zip
 - SVN add the new 10.5.9 zip.
 - Commit with a commit message simliar to the ones before it.






commit-parts - unnecessarially complicated, instructions are incomplete.
find-swearwords - pretty good rebase & edit commits to avoid specific words; but the verification seems messy.
find-bug - reasonable; though is more of a repair situation: you get pretty far without any tests . . annoying . .

It's been difficult to tell how much/what kind of training is needed. From chats with a few of you, it seems the following are most needed items.  Do you agree/disagree? What would you like to see? Git more Git!!


Prerequisite: Take this Udemy training first: Its 6 hours long; but covers the basics well: https://trivir.udemy.com/course/git-complete/learn/lecture/1438990#overview

1 - 'Git-ing Disciplined' :-) -> keeping a super deliberate branch relationships in mind.
  A - Reasoning behind super focused commits: Keep 'fixup' in mind: vs manual Interactive rebase + edit.
  B - Reasoning behind frequent fetches, frequent integration and automated tests.
  C - Mindful Merging: Being mindful of ancestry merge points between branches.
  D - When to Push & value of multi-pipeline build with tests.
2 - Effective commit tree navigation.
3 - Effective index management: not just for commits!
  A - Power of tracking files that should change vs those that shouldn't (e.g. fixing build issues)
  B - Incremental Diffing.
  C - Incremental Commiting & reason for/against.

BAES reported issues:

Request to BAES:
 - In the future please send fuller logs, and include the user name you are testing; it's helpful to provide more context. For this one we had enough.

Assumption we made:
	leaver entry = user already in eDirectory correct?
	Active Entry = user coming in on the event correct?

	SUMMARY OF ISSUE: Code is written to match the AC 1.2.2.3.3; however, the email sent in the AC recommends to fix an issue that the AC never accounts for: the user being already terminated.
	(Secondary: When checking the input doc's dates, don't bother querying if we don't need to check existing user)


BREAKDOWN:
AC 1.2.2.3.3 covers an error condition when users match on DOB/GivenName/Surname, but not contract type or start date, so an email for a manual fix is required.

Flow of events:
 - 1.2.2.1 didn't match as dest-dn was not available, meaning GCI number in eDirectory was NOT 3042547. (not in trace)
 - 1.2.2.3.1 - Didn't match, as baeContractType = "Employee", and baeCompanyStartDate = 2024-05-28.
 - 1.2.2.3.2a - start date not in the future: Check for start date in the future: Event had 2024-05-28 start date; so event should move past AC item*.
 - 1.2.2.3.2 - start date not in the future: initial check for just givenname/surname/baeDOB found UKB00084187; start date was still 2024-05-28, ideally don't even query*.
 - 1.2.2.3.3 - initial check for just givenname/surname/baeDOB found UKB00084187: since user existed, start date was more than 5 days in the past, and baeLastWorkingDay was 1899-12-31 - this error condition was recognized: The user coming in has a different GCI (3042547), has different contract type, and existing user UKB00084187 should have been terminated.
	 - The email describes a manual situation that needs to be fixed, aka terminate the existing uesr.
		 - However, POSSIBLE AC BUG: the AC 1.2.2.3.3 Never confirms that the user has a last working day in the past!

Hey guys! This is Aaron Kynaston, just wanted to start a text group to make sure everyone is on the same page.  All of you are awesome people that have already or are in the process of making my home better, and I sure appreciate it. The Santaquin 10th Ward may be doing some work in my back yard (possibly up to and including sprinklers and grass WAHOO!) and possibly garage work and I wanted to let everyone know and keep everyone updated. Even if we end up doing nothing, I am grateful to all of you for all you have done or will do.


So far that is what has happened:

1 - We submitted a request to 811 regarding digging in my yard and pipes and stuff.
2 - We've drawn a very simple outline of what we'd like to do in the back.










Hello! Our next activity will be Tuesday, August 6th at 4:00 at the blue park for some water activities. Please come in a swimming suit.  Please let us know if your boys can come! Please review this permission slip and sign asap at this link: https://www.santaquin10thward.com/primary/primary-activities

BAES multi project sync up
 - familiar with two compontens I thnik: the general upgrade, and the moving of the AS system to it sown tree.
   - ofcourse the AS extraction deals with new hardware, so we can just install what we want of course
    - on the upgrade for exstign stuff; my tendnacie would be to want to upgrade everything first, so that's out of the way and the standard we can base all of our work on rather than targeting multiple versions.


RHEL -0 7.6 - time frame? why 7.9 now? - RHEL is out of support, though not EOL.
eDirectory
idm
imanager
remote loader

June 30 RHEL 7 end of support

 - Shuan wants dates by Monday . .
 -



Support for versions
 - Need to document the versions
 - dealing with new peopl




 - Talking outloud - seems to be wise to get the upgrade done very first everywhere - as long as our mismatch to production is something we can deal with in the mean time.
 -







We will be having our activity days tonight. We are going to the Payson pool! Please meet at the Dowland's between 5:45 and 6:00. We will have a permission slip that will need to be filled out. We will drop the boys off when we get back. Please let us know if your son can make it or if you have any questions. Thanks!

Looking at our upgrade plan, I think we understand you'll eventually be going al
the way to redhat 9; I think the incremental upgrades are probably required, I think between redhat 7 and 9 there is wasn't a direct upgrade path; though the leap app seems to help .

Martin Flexman
Faris
Ian Allman - host
Shaun Briscoe

watching upgrade orders
 - why? says ian . .
 - because current stuff is out of support.
 - Some form of extended support - 6-7 months.
 - Ian shows change freeze in December 9
 - shift produciton work until after freeze.
 - Jan 13 - appears to be the unfreze date
 - ian knows about as space.
 - Added a trivir section - 10 to upgrade, 10 to test
 - want to further dig into docs; thankfully each of these upgrades appear to be a relatively small jump. I know some of the ordering can be tricky with later jumps; I need to check requiements at each upgrade step and order.
 - IDM 4.8.3 -> 4.8.6?
 - 4.8.0 AE - > 4.8.3 - sp 4
 - Quesiton: still out of support??? - at least 6 months supported from January 2025.
 - Research this
 - until april 2025 - is what Iean said . .
 - Martin: bigger jumps: inplace upgrade - Remove one replica,build new server . .
 - plan: building new servers . .
 - "Certificate strucutres" - moe to the new servers . .
 - Analysis - can burn through credits . .
 - in the next week or so:
	- plan is reasonably ok
	- understand risk
	- supportability dates
	- along wiht "cbt" "enahmcenents 3" "obsleenceice"
 - Shaun: concern about drift between environments
 - Ian: CBT and other projects need to
 - need to chat with shaun nxt
 - 8.8/8.9/92/9.3 concern etc:

		One item does concern me - edir 9.2 lists a few supported OSes: https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-92/edir_install/data/a79kg0t.html - and shows RHEL 8.8, 8.9, and RHEL 9.2, 9.3 . . seems odd that we're only considering RHEL 7.6 to 7.9 . .something seems off; yet - it is possible we are the people that helped them get on what they are on now . .we may want to double check current versions during this call if we have access to an SSH session.


 - RHEL 7.6 7.9

BAES writeup:
AC 1.2.2.3.3 -
  - line 14207     <Company_Start_Date>2022-06-28T00:00:00+01:00</Company_Start_Date> received
  - company start date rule: AS-RO-1008
  - function call appears incorrect:
    - validateDate(attributeValue, 64, 50)
    - the lower range and upper range values appear swapped.
  - Also, the code appears to interpret these values as years; yet they are reporting a 5 day error; we should talk on this one.



AC 1.2.2.7 -

   - The trace shows there was not a match as there was an already existing object that was already associated. If this identical test was repeated, when UKB00504818 was not already associated to the SF driver, it should have succeeded.
    [06/26/24 11:42:31.332]:sf PT:Found an associated object.
    [06/26/24 11:42:31.332]:sf PT:Merging eDirectory and application values.
    [06/26/24 11:42:31.333]:sf PT:Reading relevant attributes from BAES\Users\UKB00504818.

Other Minor issues we'll want to consider resolving:
  Issue 1: the "Last Day Worked set to the past" rule attempted to get baeLastWorkingDay, but it wasn't available; in fact, it did a 'token-attr' which attempts to read from the source if it wasn't avaialble in the event. It should probably be just token-op-attr, and then allowed to fail if not populated . .assuming it can be missing from the input doc.
     - note: the lastworkding day provided was '1899-12-31' and this is considered the 'blank value' . .so we shouldn't try to get if it's not already present; change token-attr to token-op-attr.

  Issue 2: the Rule: SuccessFactors-Driver/Publisher/pub-cmd-users#XmlData:26: should be updated to avoid converting blank dates:
     - Couldn't convert date/time '': java.text.ParseException: Unparseable date: ""
     - If it isn't available; it shouldn't attempt to parse.

Since my voice is goofed, I figured I'd add a comment here:

Correct me if I'm wrong Joey, It seems like the main pain point here is that we aren't talking enough. Estimates, clickup, statuses, etc: all of it is to keep us talking at the right time.

For me, it was fear stopping me from talking in the past; either due to a goofed estimate, fear of exposing ignorance, etc: If you have fear, it's already tme to talk :-)
