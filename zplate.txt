0 - Sailpoint efforts: documenting what can be done in drivers to help convert to sailPoint
   - Dhivya & Gokul: desire to document everything we can for the sail-point migration.
  Next action: 9/12/2025 2:47:05 PM- I asked Dhivya what format she wants - I want aux/hints file.

1 - IDtoApptioFrontDoor - code complete; needs MyAccess end-to-end testing.
  Next action: deploy latest to QA if needed, and do MyAccess testing.

2 - IDtoApptioTargetProcess - about 80% code complete; needs MyAccess end-to-end testing.
  Next action: deploy latest to QA if needed, and do MyAccess testing.
     - adding last deploy test, and sync test
     - then review of documentation with app owner to pick up any other missing functionality.

3 - IDtoAviobook -
  9/15/2025 2:42:27 PM- Nirosha completed the deploy

4 - IDtoSprinkler - On Gokul's todo list.
  Next action: None, Gokul is running with this driver currently, Gokul's status from: 9/12/2025 2:17:46 PM

  Gokul is mostly working on this: here's the status:
   - LOA changes: Gokul
   - Multi-role support: Gokul
   - early scoping policy: Gokul
   - early attr check policy: Gokul
   - move environment specific clientID to GCV: Gokul
   - remove roles during deactivation: Gokul
   - updating wnco.com address to wncotest.com in the test excel: Gokul
   - Confirming: Devin is checking whether email reuse will be an issue - Gokul.

   Items we will not do:
   - NOT WORKING ON: Any non-critical changes/main documetnation will not be done; in preference of the
   move to Sailpiont - NO ONE ASSIGNED TO THIS; NOT WORKING ON IT
   - NOT WORKING ON: some of the roles in Test Excel exist ONLY in Sprinklr DEV environment and not in PROD. But not going to touch itNO ONE ASSIGNED TO THIS; NOT WORKING ON IT

5 - IDtoEmployeeSvc: Gokul QA work, need to check in, and then do 12 stories on https://southwest.atlassian.net/browse/CYSEE-929
  Next action: 9/12/2025 2:48:29 PM - Gokul says we're waiting on them to finish CMAppTest in QA; then we'll move to SWAFC3, then we can pull commits from his branch.
     - Nirosha: may contact Gokul on this to check-in 9/12/2025 3:42:11 PM

6 - IDtoAltea: 9/12/2025 3:38:58 PM Joe has some new work.
  Next Action: 9/12/2025 3:43:06 PM- wait for answer from Joe regarding new work.

7 - RBEAEv1 - Need to document how to manage the entitlement exports: it's the first and only driver to have entitlements, and we're manging them with LDIF only; and it is not obvious how the process works.
  Next Action: 9/12/2025 2:48:45 PM- write documentation.

8 - IDtoDocuware
  Next Action: 9/12/2025 3:55:06 PM- so far, transfered to Nirosha.

  - 9/12/2025 1:55:28 PM- QA has had a data truncation issue. Driver needs 3-5 stories of fixes; no current prod issues.
  Next Action: find out why 'Data truncation' issue is happening in QA, then reproduce in IdMUnit test, and then create stories.
  - Also needs working IdMUnit-config: it doesn't have a 'Docuware' connection!
  - See if this driver is still important and being used: Naveen Kumar Konduri - not the app owner . . "Silicon Savvy Pod-DG" is the app owner.
  - Find out who the app owner is.
  - Add IDToDocuware IdMUnit connection config to idmunit-config.xml
  - Run tests, confirm they all pass.
  - Review the issue in QA: driver is in an infinite retry loop due to the "data truncation issue"
  - Reproduce issue in a new test.
  - Reconcile the driver in DEV, QA, Prod with the Git gold copy; and see what deployments are needed.
  - Discuss with Aaron regarding what difference you see and decide on what needs to be done.
  - Make a plan
  - Execute!

9 - LMS driver - Nirosha's todo list - - 9/12/2025 3:28:23 PM
  - Next Action: On Nirosha's state.

10 - IronClad driver: Nirosha's todo list - 9/12/2025 3:28:49 PM
  - Next Action: to deploy to prod in disabled state, another IDM engineer can enable . .
