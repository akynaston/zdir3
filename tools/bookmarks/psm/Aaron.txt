NOte I sent to the team regarding the python script workaround:

Team,

One more link for you: once you've confirmed you have access, I've confirmed this python script (GetPSMKeys.py) works great to retrieve the keys automatically, with one caveat:  The DEV & QA HTTPS urls use certificates that we don't have trusted in our browsers; I'm waiting on a fix.

DETAILS ON WORKAROUND:
There is a workaround for the failure to get keys in DEV/QA: Add this to line 364 in your script:

    chrome_options.add_argument(" --ignore-certificate-errors")

I'm waiting on some cert installation stuff that's supposed to be coming through softwarecenter, but I haven't seen it yet; this is the correct path forward, instead of just ignoring the certificates, but it is not complete yet.
